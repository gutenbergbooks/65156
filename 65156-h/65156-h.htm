frank and generous disposition, he would have been
ruined by indulgence even in his boyhood. When,
however, at fifteen, he left home for college, he still
possessed the elements of a noble character, and had
he then been entrusted to a careful tutor, he might
have been saved years of folly and subsequent misery.
But, thrown among the hundreds of youth of
his own age who thronged the institution whither he
was sent, with no one to guide him aright, and habits
of wilfulness, contracted at home, to urge him on
wherever whim might lead him, he soon fell into the
temptations incident to a large college, and, without
intending evil so much as seeking for amusement,
became notorious for his frolics, idleness, and even
dissipation. He had not been at the university a
year before his name was regarded as that of the
worst member of his class. His progress in study
was deficient, and his expenses great. His doating
father at first overlooked his son’s irregularities,
thinking they would soon wear off; but when term
after term elapsed, and there was no appearance of
reformation, he expostulated strongly, almost sternly,
with his child. For a time James was moved,
and almost shook off his unworthy companions. But
the effort to cut loose from them altogether required
more energy than he was capable of, and as no reformation
can be lasting when only half complete,
he soon relapsed into his old habits, and, before the
term was up, was as notorious as ever for being the
leader in every mischievous or even disreputable
action. This could not last. More than once he
had been warned by the faculty, and weekly—almost
daily—did his friends, by letter, expostulate with
him. Frank, generous and good-intentioned, he constantly
determined to amend his conduct; but his
very open-heartedness, by rendering him incapable
of resisting temptation, prevented every lasting effort
at reformation. Each failure likewise placed
him more and more in the power of his gay companions.
The result is easily told. In his second
year, he was detected in a flagrant violation of the
college rules, and, as expostulation had been used
again and again in vain, he was expelled from the
university. The blow fell like a thunderbolt on his
parents. His father was a rigidly correct, and
withal a proud man, and, in proportion to the affection
with which he regarded his son, was the conviction
of the disgrace thus brought upon his name. In
the first emotions of his anger, he almost vowed
never to look on the face of his son again. But the
prayers of the fond mother at length prevailed; he
relented, and James was once more received under
the paternal roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must not be supposed that the youth was callous
to his disgrace. He felt it acutely, and the more
acutely because, as every good principle was not yet
eradicated from his heart, he was conscious that he
deserved his degradation. He saw, too, how deeply
injured were the feelings of his parents; and he determined
to thoroughly reform. He kept his word.
For the year that he remained under the paternal
roof, he seemed another being. But, in a fatal hour,
his father yielded to his solicitations to allow him to
study a profession, and he was accordingly sent to
Philadelphia, to commence a course of lectures at the
celebrated university of that city. Who might not
have foretold the result? Almost imperceptibly,
and, to a disposition like his, unavoidably, he was
seduced back into his old courses, and, before the
winter was over, he became once more celebrated as
one of the most idle and dissipated students of his
class. The arrival of a few of his old companions in
college, to begin their studies for a profession, completed
his ruin. He plunged into every extravagance.
His allowance, liberal as it was, fell far short of his
expenses. His bills soon accumulated to a fearful
amount. Dreading to acquaint his parent with their
extent, and in order to relieve himself from their
load, he did what hitherto he had shunned—he resorted
to the gaming table. For a while he was successful,
for he had always been accounted a skilful
player, and believing he now had a resource for every
emergency, he plunged still deeper into extravagance
of every character. But suddenly his luck failed
him. He lost. Again he essayed to retrieve his fortune—again
he was unsuccessful. His bills had
meantime accumulated to a fearful amount; and
knowing that he had no hope for succor from his parent,
he made a desperate attempt to retrieve his
losses. It was in vain. Not only did he fail to retrieve
his luck, but he went forth a ruined man,
having involved himself even still deeper. For a
while he was frantic with despair. As a last resort,
he determined on applying to his mother, well knowing
that she would look with more leniency on him
than his sterner father would. He waited breathlessly
for an answer. It came, directed in his father’s
handwriting. He opened the epistle with a trembling
hand, and beating heart, and read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your letter found your mother on a sick bed,
unable to receive any intelligence, and, as we knew
from whom the packet came, I opened it. Its contents
will account for the style of this epistle. You
are no longer a son of mine. Two years ago, when
you brought the disgrace on your name of having
been expelled ignominiously from college, I almost
vowed never to acknowledge you as a son of mine.
I relented, however, and took you again into favor.
I see now how useless it was. Again you have
brought shame on my gray hairs; and I now make
the determination to disown you wholly. Enclosed
is a thousand dollars, for I will not send you penniless
on the world. Let me never again hear from
you. Change your name, since you will dishonor the
one I bear, and remember that your own folly has
cut loose every tie betwixt you and</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'><span class='sc'>George L. Vernon</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The letter fell from the hands of the young man as
he ceased reading, and for some moments, without
uttering a word, he gazed on it as it lay on the floor
at his feet. In that minute how his whole past life
rushed through his memory! He thought of his infancy;
his early childhood; the rooms where he
played; his little sister; his mother; the servants;
every old familiar place and thing, all now shut out
to him forever. Had he deserved to be treated with
such harshness? His passion blinded him as he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! I have not deserved it. I will be under no
obligations to one who can thus heartlessly cast me
off. He disowns me—does he? Let it be. Never
will I sue for a favor again at any of their hands.
From this day forth they shall be to me as the dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shall we follow him through his career of subsequent
desperation and eventual profligacy, or shall
we at once draw to a close?</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than a year had passed since Vernon had
been disowned by his parent, and he was now an
outcast, and almost penniless. In all that time he
had heard nothing of home. He had seen, in the interval,
every variety of life. The gaming table had
been his principal resort, for after having, with the
remittance made to him by his father, discharged his
debts of honor, he had so little left that he saw no
other resource from starvation. The vicissitudes of
a gambler’s life are well known; the inevitable result—poverty—is
ever the same. By the time a
twelvemonth had elapsed, Vernon was almost penniless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With only a few dollars in his pocket, he one night
entered a low gaming house, and for some time
betted without either loss or gain. At length, however,
he lost. He threw down another stake, and
that too was swept up by the banker. His last dollar
was in his hand, ready to be put up, when he
paused, and the question flashed across his mind,
what if he should lose again? Never before had he
been so near to utter poverty. He had even no place
where he might lodge that night, and, save that dollar,
he owned nothing in the wide world but the garments
he wore. He paused, and turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cards pass,” said the banker. “You do not
bet this time, sir?—another chance, and you retrieve
your loss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the young man hesitated. The banker lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cards pass,” said the banker again; “you
see you would have won, sir. How much do you
put up now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man glanced fiercely at the speaker,
hesitated an instant, and half turned away again;
but the temptation to try his luck once more was too
great, and hastily throwing down his dollar, he
grasped the cards convulsively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty!” said the banker, flinging his cards
with a smile on the table. “Sir, you have lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man stared wildly at the hoary villain,
and then grinding his teeth together fiercely, with
ill-concealed despair, he pushed the piece towards
his tempter, cast a stern defying glance around the
room at the curious spectators of the scene, and
strode from the apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph!” said the banker, “I’ll bet it’s his last
dollar—who takes me up? No one, eh! Then,
gentlemen, proceed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had the young man reached the street
than he paused, and looking up at the gay windows
of the room he had left, he shook his clenched hand
fiercely at them, and exclaimed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curses on ye for the ruin ye have brought upon
me!—ay! ten thousand curses on ye and your
hoary owners!” and then the recollection of his
poverty seeming to cross his mind in another guise,
he added, less passionately, “My God! not a cent
have they left me, even to buy a night’s shelter. Oh!
that I had never left my father’s house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For hours he wandered up and down the streets,
now inflamed to madness by his despair, now melting
at the recollection of the happy days he had once
enjoyed under his father’s roof. Morning still found
him a wanderer. Pale, dejected and spirit-broken,
he entered, at early dawn, an obscure coffee-house,
just as the sleepy menials were opening the shutters,
and sitting moodily down, picked up the morning
paper. The first paragraph that his eye lit upon
was as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Died, on the 5th inst., after a lingering illness,
which she bore with Christian meekness and fortitude,
<span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span>, wife of <span class='sc'>George L. Vernon</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The paper dropped from his grasp. For an instant
all power of speech left him. Then rushed across
his mind the recollection of a thousand things which
that mother had done for her erring boy. And she
had died—died without forgiving him! Oh! at
that moment, he would have given worlds to have
recalled her to life, in order that he might kneel at
her feet and solicit her pardon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will arise,” at length he said, in the language
of scripture, “and go unto my father. I will sue for
permission to behold her face in death; surely that
they will not deny me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he arose. Completely changed in spirit, that
erring son, after nearly a day’s travel, arrived at his
native village. He had parted with every available
thing to obtain funds for the journey, and reached
his father’s house just before night, penniless. He
knocked hastily at the door, not giving himself time
to notice that the house bore no signs of mourning.
The old housekeeper, who happened to be crossing
the hall at the time the servant admitted him, could
scarcely repress a scream of surprise at seeing her
young master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake,” gasped the penitent, “Mrs.
Irwin, lead me to my mother; let me see her before
the grave closes over her forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The almost incoherent words and eager, impassioned
gestures of the penitent for a moment bewildered
the good woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother! Mr. James—she is not dead; but
you have seen the newspapers’ mistake, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not dead!” exclaimed he, falling on his knees;
“then I thank thee, oh! my Creator, that I can yet
sue for her forgiveness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, then, my dear boy,” said the old housekeeper,
bursting into tears, “and let me take you
in to your parents. Oh! I have prayed for this hour
night and day, and I knew that it would come;” and
while the tears fell thick and fast down her aged
cheeks, she led the now passive penitent across the
hall, opened the door of the drawing-room, and
ushered in the returning prodigal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One glance around that well-remembered room
was sufficient for the young man. His mother sat in
her easy chair, wrapped in a large shawl, and bearing
evident traces of a late illness; his sister was at
her piano, playing one of the old airs which he had
heard a thousand times from her; and his silver-haired
father sat betwixt the mother and daughter,
engaged in his usual occupation of reading. Yet,
oh! how care-worn were the faces of all! And this
was the work of that prodigal son. As he saw it all,
a gush of old feelings swept across the penitent’s
soul, and falling on his knees, he buried his face in
his hands, and sobbed aloud in his remorse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My boy!—come to my arms,” said the mother,
almost hysterically, awarding her forgiveness almost
before it was solicited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not so the father. Rising with a frown from his
chair, he was about to advance on the intruder, when
the daughter, rushing towards him, lifted her beseeching
eyes to her parent’s, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, only look at him—do but hear him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the conflict in that father’s bosom
almost shook his frame with emotion. At first he
turned away, refusing to see his boy; but in every
line of his agitated face might be seen the struggle
betwixt affection for his son and his sense of injury.
Nature at length triumphed; he suffered himself to
be led towards the penitent, and the next moment
the members of the re-united family were sobbing
alternately in each other’s arms.</p>

<div><h1><a id='coll'></a>THE COLLOQUY OF MONOS AND UNA.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY EDGAR A. POE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Una.</span> “Born again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Monos.</span> Yes, fairest and best beloved Una, “born
again.” These were the words upon whose mystical
meaning I had so long pondered, rejecting the
explanations of the priesthood, until Death himself
resolved for me the secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Una.</span> Death!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Monos.</span> How strangely, sweet Una, you echo my
words! I observe, too, a vacillation in your step—a
joyous inquietude in your eyes. You are confused
and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the Life
Eternal. Yes, it was of Death I spoke. And here
how singularly sounds that word which of old was
wont to bring terror to all hearts—throwing a mildew
upon all pleasures!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Una.</span> Ah, Death, the spectre which sate at all
feasts! How often, Monos, did we lose ourselves
in speculations upon its nature! How mysteriously
did it act as a check to human bliss—saying unto it
“thus far, and no farther!” That earnest mutual
love, my own Monos, which burned within our bosoms—how
vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling
happy in its first upspringing, that our happiness
would strengthen with its strength! Alas! as it
grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of that evil
hour which was hurrying to separate us forever!
Thus, in time, it became painful to love. Hate
would have been mercy then.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Monos.</span> Speak not here of these griefs, dear
Una—mine, mine forever now!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Una.</span> But the memory of past sorrow—is it not
present joy? I have much to say yet of the things
which have been. Above all, I burn to know the incidents
of your own passage through the dark Valley
and Shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Monos.</span> And when did the radiant Una ask anything
of her Monos in vain? I will be minute in relating
all—but at what point shall the weird narrative
begin?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Una.</span> At what point?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Monos.</span> You have said.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Una.</span> Monos, I comprehend you. In Death we
have both learned the propensity of man to define
the indefinable. I will not say, then, commence
with the moment of life’s cessation—but commence
with that sad, sad instant when, the fever having
abandoned you, you sank into a breathless and motionless
torpor, and I pressed down your pallid eyelids
with the passionate fingers of love.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Monos.</span> One word first, my Una, in regard to
man’s general condition at this epoch. You will remember
that one or two of the wise among our forefathers—wise
in fact, although not in the world’s
esteem—had ventured to doubt the propriety of the
term “improvement,” as applied to the progress of
our civilization. There were periods in each of the
five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution,
when arose some vigorous intellect, boldly
contending for those principles whose truth appears
now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious—principles
which should have taught our race
to submit to the guidance of the natural laws, rather
than attempt their control. At long intervals some
master-minds appeared, looking upon each advance
in practical science as a retro-gradation in the true
utility. Occasionally the poetic intellect—that intellect
which we now feel to have been the most exalted
of all—since those truths which to us were of
the most enduring importance could only be reached
by that <span class='it'>analogy</span> which speaks in proof-tones to the
imagination alone, and to the unaided reason bears
no weight—occasionally did this poetic intellect
proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague
idea of the philosophic, and find in the mystic
parable that tells of the tree of knowledge, and of its
forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct intimation
that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant
condition of his soul. And these men—the poets—living
and perishing amid the scorn of the “utilitarians”—of
rough pedants, who arrogated to themselves
a title which could have been properly applied
only to the scorned—these men, the poets,
pondered piningly, yet not unwisely, upon the ancient
days when our wants were not more simple
than our enjoyments were keen—days when <span class='it'>mirth</span>
was a word unknown, so solemnly deep-toned was
happiness—holy, august and blissful days, when
blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn,
into far forest solitudes, primæval, odorous, and unexplored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet these noble exceptions from the general misrule
served but to strengthen it by opposition. Alas!
we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil days.
The great “movement”—that was the cant term—went
on:—a diseased commotion, moral and physical.
Art—the Arts—arose supreme, and, once enthroned,
cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated
them to power. Man, because he could not but
acknowledge the majesty of Nature, fell into childish
exultation at his acquired and still-increasing dominion
over her elements. Even while he stalked a
god in his own fancy, an infantine imbecility came
over him. As might be supposed from the origin of
his disorder, he grew infected with system, and with
abstraction. He enwrapped himself in generalities.
Among other odd ideas, those of universal equality
gained ground; and in the face of analogy and of
God—in despite of the loud warning voice of the
laws of <span class='it'>gradation</span> so visibly pervading all things in
Earth and Heaven—wild attempts at an omni-prevalent
Democracy were made. Yet this evil sprang
necessarily from the leading evil, Knowledge. Man
could not both know and succumb. Meantime huge
smoking cities arose, innumerable. Green leaves
shrank before the hot breath of furnaces. The fair
face of Nature was deformed as with the ravages of
some loathsome disease. And methinks, sweet Una,
even our slumbering sense of the forced and of the
far-fetched might have arrested us here. But now it
appears that we had worked out our own destruction
in the perversion of our <span class='it'>taste</span>, or rather in the blind
neglect of its culture in the schools. For, in truth,
it was at this crisis that taste alone—that faculty
which, holding a middle position between the pure
intellect and the moral sense, could never safely
have been disregarded—it was now that taste alone
could have led us gently back to Beauty, to Nature,
and to Life. But alas for the pure contemplative
spirit and majestic intuition of Plato! Alas for the
μουσικη which he justly regarded as an all-sufficient
education for the soul! Alas for him and for it!—since
both were most desperately needed when both
were most entirely forgotten or despised.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has
said, how truly!—“<span class='it'>que tout notre raisonnement se
rèduit à céder au sentiment</span>;” and it is not impossible
that the sentiment of the natural, had time permitted
it, would have regained its old ascendancy
over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools.
But this thing was not to be. Prematurely induced
by intemperance of knowledge, the old age of the
world drew on. This the mass of mankind saw not,
or, living lustily although unhappily, affected not to
see. But, for myself, the Earth’s records had taught
me to look for widest ruin as the price of highest
civilization. I had imbibed a prescience of our Fate
from comparison of China the simple and enduring,
with Assyria the architect, with Egypt the astrologer,
with Nubia, more crafty than either, the turbulent
mother of all Arts. In history<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> of these regions
I met with a ray from the Future. The individual
artificialities of the three latter were local diseases
of the Earth, and in their individual overthrows we
had seen local remedies applied; but for the infected
world at large I could anticipate no regeneration
save in death. That man, as a race, should not become
extinct, I saw that he must be “<span class='it'>born again</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now it was, fairest and dearest, that we
busied our souls, daily, in dreams. Now it was that,
in twilight, we discoursed of the days to come, when
the Art-scarred surface of the Earth, having undergone
that purification<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> which alone could efface its
rectangular obscenities, should clothe itself anew in
the verdure and the mountain-slopes and the smiling
waters of Paradise, and be rendered at length a fit
dwelling-place for man:—for man the Death-purged—for
man to whose now exalted intellect
there should be poison in knowledge no more—for
the redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal,
but still for the <span class='it'>material</span>, man.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Una.</span> Well do I remember these conversations,
dear Monos; but the epoch of the fiery overthrow
was not so near at hand as we believed, and as the
corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing.
Men lived; and died individually. You
yourself sickened, and passed into the grave; and
thither your constant Una speedily followed you.
And though the century which has since elapsed, and
whose conclusion brings us thus together once more,
tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience
of duration, yet, my Monos, it was a century
still.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Monos.</span> Say, rather, a point in the vague infinity.
Unquestionably, it was in the Earth’s dotage that I
died. Wearied at heart with anxieties which had
their origin in the general turmoil and decay, I succumbed
to the fierce fever. After some few days of
pain, and many of dreamy delirium replete with
ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for
pain, while I longed but was impotent to undeceive
you—after some days there came upon me, as you
have said, a breathless and motionless torpor; and
this was termed <span class='it'>Death</span> by those who stood around
me. Words are vague things. My condition did
not deprive me of sentience. It appeared to me not
greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of him
who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying
motionless and fully prostrate in a midsummer noon,
begins to steal slowly back into consciousness,
through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without
being awakened by external disturbances. I
breathed no longer. The pulses were still. The
heart had ceased to beat. Volition had not departed
but was powerless. The senses were unusually active,
although eccentrically so—assuming often
each other’s functions at random. The taste and the
smell were inextricably confounded, and became one
sentiment, abnormal and intense. The rose-water
with which your tenderness had moistened my lips
to the last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers—fantastic
flowers, far more lovely than any of
the old Earth, but whose prototypes we have here
blooming around us. The eyelids, transparent and
bloodless, offered no complete impediment to vision.
As volition was in abeyance, the balls could not roll
in their sockets—but all objects within the range of
the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less
distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external
retina, or into the corner of the eye, producing a
more vivid effect than those which struck the front
or interior surface. Yet, in the former instance, this
effect was so far anomalous that I appreciated it
only as <span class='it'>sound</span>—sound sweet or discordant as the
matters presenting themselves at my side were light
or dark in shade—curved or angular in outline.
The hearing, at the same time, although excited in
degree, was not irregular in action—estimating real
sounds with an extravagance of precision, not less
than of sensibility. Touch had undergone a modification
more peculiar. Its impressions were tardily
received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted
always in the highest physical pleasure. Thus the
pressure of your sweet fingers upon my eyelids, at
first only recognised through vision, at length, long
after their removal, filled my whole being with a
sensual delight immeasurable. I say with a sensual
delight. <span class='it'>All</span> my perceptions were purely sensual.
The materials furnished the passive brain by the
senses were not in the least degree wrought into
shape by the deceased understanding. Of pain there
was some little; of pleasure there was much; but of
moral pain or pleasure none at all. Thus your wild
sobs floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences,
and were appreciated in their every variation
of sad tone; but they were soft musical sounds and
no more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation
of the sorrows which gave them birth;
while the large and constant tears which fell upon
my face, telling the bystanders of a heart which
broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy
alone. And this was in truth the <span class='it'>Death</span> of which
these bystanders spoke reverently, in low whispers—you,
sweet Una, gaspingly, with loud cries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They attired me for the coffin—three or four dark
figures which flitted busily to and fro. As these
crossed the direct line of my vision they affected me
as <span class='it'>forms</span>; but upon passing to my side their images
impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and
other dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of
wo. You alone, habited in a white robe, passed in
all directions musically about me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I
became possessed by a vague uneasiness—an anxiety
such as the sleeper feels when sad real sounds fall
continuously within his ear—low distant bell-tones,
solemn, at long but equal intervals, and commingling
with melancholy dreams. Night arrived; and with
its shadows a heavy discomfort. It oppressed my
limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and
was palpable. There was also a moaning sound, not
unlike the distant reverberation of surf, but more
continuous, which, beginning with the first twilight,
had grown in strength with the darkness. Suddenly
lights were brought into the room, and this reverberation
became forthwith interrupted into frequent
unequal bursts of the same sound, but less dreary
and less distinct. The ponderous oppression was in
a great measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame
of each lamp, (for there were many,) there flowed
unbrokenly into my ears a strain of melodious monotone.
And when now, dear Una, approaching the
bed upon which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by
my side, breathing odor from your sweet lips, and
pressing them upon my brow, there arose tremulously
within my bosom, and mingling with the merely
physical sensations which circumstances had called
forth, a something akin to sentiment itself—a feeling
that, half appreciating, half responded to your
earnest love and sorrow; but this feeling took no
root in the pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather
a shadow than a reality, and faded quickly away,
first into extreme quiescence, and then into a purely
sensual pleasure as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, from the wreck and the chaos of the
usual senses, there appeared to have arisen within
me a sixth, all perfect. In its exercise I found a
wild delight—yet a delight still physical, inasmuch
as the understanding had in it no part. Motion in
the animal frame had fully ceased. No muscle
quivered; no nerve thrilled; no artery throbbed.
But there seemed to have sprung up in the brain,
<span class='it'>that</span> of which no words could convey to the merely
human intelligence even an indistinct definition.
Let me term it a mental pendulous pulsation. It
was the moral embodiment of man’s abstract idea of
<span class='it'>Time</span>. By the absolute equalization of this movement—or
of such as this—had the cycles of the firmamental
orbs themselves, been adjusted. By its
aid I measured the irregularities of the clock upon
the mantel, and of the watches of the attendants.
Their tickings came sonorously to my ears. The
slightest deviations from the true proportion—and
these deviations were omni-prævalent—affected me
just as violations of abstract truth were wont, on
earth, to affect the moral sense. Although no two
of the time-pieces in the chamber struck the individual
seconds accurately together, yet I had no difficulty
in holding steadily in mind the tones, and the
respective momentary errors of each. And this—this
keen, perfect, self-existing sentiment of <span class='it'>duration</span>—this
sentiment existing (as man could not possibly
have conceived it to exist) independently of
any succession of events—this idea—this sixth
sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was
the first obvious and certain step of the intemporal
soul upon the threshold of the temporal Eternity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was midnight; and you still sat by my side.
All others had departed from the chamber of Death.
They had deposited me in the coffin. The lamps
burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the tremulousness
of the monotonous strains. But, suddenly
these strains diminished in distinctness and in volume.
Finally they ceased. The perfume in my nostrils
died away. Forms affected my vision no longer.
The oppression of the Darkness uplifted itself
from my bosom. A dull shock like that of electricity
pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss
of the idea of contact. All of what man has termed
sense was merged in the sole consciousness of entity,
and in the one abiding sentiment of duration. The
mortal body had been at length stricken with the
hand of the deadly <span class='it'>Decay</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet had not all of sentience departed; for the
consciousness and the sentiment remaining supplied
some of its functions by a lethargic intuition. I appreciated
the direful change now in operation upon
the flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of
the bodily presence of one who leans over him, so,
sweet Una, I still dully felt that you sat by my side.
So, too, when the noon of the second day came, I
was not unconscious of those movements which displaced
you from my side, which confined me within
the coffin, which deposited me within the hearse,
which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within
it, which heaped heavily the mould upon me, and
thus left me in blackness and corruption to my sad
slumbers with the worm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here, in the prison-house, which has few secrets
to disclose, there rolled away days and weeks
and solemn months, and the soul watched narrowly
each second as it flew, and, without effort, took
record of its flight—without effort and without object.
Meantime the worm, with its convulsive motion,
writhed untorturing and unheeded about me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A year passed. The consciousness of <span class='it'>being</span> had
grown hourly more indistinct, and that of mere <span class='it'>locality</span>
had, in great measure, usurped its position. The
idea of entity was becoming merged in that of <span class='it'>place</span>.
The narrow space immediately surrounding what
had been the body, was now growing to be the body
itself. At length, as often happens to the sleeper
(by sleep and its world alone is <span class='it'>Death</span> imaged)—at
length, as sometimes happened on Earth to the deep
slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him
into awaking, yet left him half enveloped in dreams—so
to me, in the strict embrace of the <span class='it'>Shadow</span>, came
<span class='it'>that</span> light which alone might have had power to
startle—the light of enduring <span class='it'>Love</span>. Men toiled at
the grave in which I lay darkling. They upthrew
the damp earth. Upon my mouldering bones there
descended the coffin of Una.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now again all was void. That nebulous light
had been extinguished. That feeble thrill had vibrated
itself into quiescence. Many lustra had supervened.
Dust had returned to dust. The worm
had food no more. The sense of being had at length
utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead—instead
of all things—dominant and perpetual—the
autocrats <span class='it'>Place</span> and <span class='it'>Time</span>. For <span class='it'>that</span> which <span class='it'>was not</span>—for
that which had no form—for that which had no
thought—for that which had no sentience—for that
which was soulless, yet of which matter formed no
portion—for all this nothingness, yet for all this immortality,
the grave was still a home, and the corrosive
hours, co-mates.</p>

<div><h1><a id='ass'></a>THE ASSAULT.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY J. H. DANA.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the last morning of the assault. The sun
had risen heavily across the eastern highlands, flinging
his slant beams upon the embattled armies of the
cross, and disclosing, as the mists rolled upwards
from the valley, mangonel, and tower, and battering-ram,
and serried troops of warriors, drawn up in array
before Jerusalem,—and now as the shout “to the
Holy City,” swelled out upon the air, and the priests,
in sacerdotal robes, lifted up their chaunt again, the
whole vast mass, as if by a simultaneous impulse,
moved forward from their stations, and with lance,
and shield, and banner, and shouts of triumph, and
clashing of arms, marched on to the assault. All
Europe was up. Prince and subject; noble and serf;
layman and monk; the rich and the poor; the proud
and the humble; old, young, and middle aged; stalwart
men and feeble women; the knight in his armor,
and the boor in his capote,—the bishop with his
crozier, and the friar in his cowl; the halt, the deaf,
the blind; all ranks and conditions of life swelled
the gigantic host, which, gathering new accessions
to its numbers in every land it traversed, had rolled
on with threatening aspect over Palestine, carrying
terror and desolation to the Saracens, until at length
the mighty army was now arrayed before Jerusalem,
burning to achieve the redemption of the sepulchre.
Yes! Europe was there in arms, moved as one man,
by one spirit. From hill and dale; from city and
hamlet; from the castle of the noble and the cottage
of the boor; from cloister, and forge, and plough, the
sons of the church had gathered at her summons,
fired with a lofty determination to avenge an insulted
faith, and scourge back to the fastnesses from
whence they came the sacrilegious followers of the
crescent. There was the bluff Englishman, the fair-haired
German, the tall gaunt Scot, the gay cavalier
from Provence, the dark eyed son of Italy, and the
wild and uncouth child of that green “Erin,” of the
ocean, lying on the utmost verge of civilization, and
known only by vague rumor as the habitation of
man. Ay! all these were there—there, with spear,
and sword, and cross-bow—there, in glittering
casque, and homely jerkin—there, on proudly caparisoned
steeds, or marching with soiled buskin humbly
on foot. Soldiers of every garb, tongue, and
nation; men who had been enemies but were now
friends; warriors, who had hitherto lived only
for rapine, joined in that wild shout, and with an
enthusiasm they had never felt before, swept on the
second time to the assault—and ever as they
marched, in solid phalanx or open column, Frank,
or Saxon, or Italian, they swelled out the cry, “Ho!
soldiers of the cross—on to the Holy City!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the battle was joined. Foremost of all,
in his lofty tower, stood Godfrey of Bouillon, cheering
on the attack, and directing his unerring shafts
against every one who appeared upon the walls;—while
beneath and around him, plying mangonel and
battering-ram, or showering arrows on the foe,
pressed on the humbler soldiers of the cross—ay!
pressed on, although the missiles of the Saracens
poured down like rain, and melted lead, and scalding
water, and fire itself, fell thick and fast upon the
hosts of the assailants. And still on they pressed,
and though the ground was strewed with the dying,
and every moment some new assailant fell, the gallant
line of the Crusaders never swerved, but as fast
as one went down another filled his place; and as
the long hours of the morning passed away, and the
Saracens maintained their walls, fighting with the
desperation of men who were contending for their
homes, the fearless assailers kept pressing on to the
attack, determined to succeed in the assault or leave
their bones to bleach before the walls. One universal
enthusiasm pervaded the whole host. Old and
young; peaceful monks and timid women; the sick,
the halt, the dumb, came forth from the camp,
bringing weapons for those who had spent their
missiles, carrying water for the parched combatants,
or cheering the dying in their last moments of mortal
agony. And higher and higher mounted the sun,
and sultry and more sultry grew the air, yet still the
Saracens made good their walls, and when the exhausted
soldiers were almost fainting from the fatigues
of the day, the beseiged made one more
desperate rally, and, collecting all their strength for
a last effort, they bore down upon the soldiers of the
cross, and drove them, with terrific slaughter, from
the walls. Back—back—back they fled, in wild
dismay. In vain their leaders attempted to rally the
worn-out soldiers; they themselves could scarcely
support their frames, exhausted by their heavy armor
and the stifling heat of noonday. Further effort
was hopeless. The despair was general. A wild
shout of exultation rung out from the walls, as the
Saracens seized the image of a cross, spat upon it,
and cast it, with insulting gestures, into the ditch.
The taunt stung the assailants to the heart. At that
instant a shining horseman, clad in armor brighter
than the day, and waving on high a sword that shone
with the brilliancy of the sun seven times brightened,
was seen upon the Mount of Olives, beckoning to the
discomposed assailants, and pointing onwards to the
Holy Sepulchre; and as one after another of the
wearied crusaders beheld the blessed vision, sighs,
groans, and tears burst from the assembled thousands,
and clashing their arms deliriously aloft, and waving
their banners wildly to and fro upon the air, they
cried out, “Ho! soldiers of the cross—on to the
Holy City!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And on they swept. Horse and foot; archer and
man-at-arms; wounded and unhurt; noble and retainer;
Frank, Gaul, and German; the Saxon, and
Tuscan; the old, the young, the middle aged; leader
and follower; proud and humble; free and bond;—on—on—on
they pressed, as if a whirlwind had
sent them reeling upon the foe, bearing every thing
down before them, plying cross-bow and mangonel,
hurling huge stones that crushed the foe like glass,
and heaving battering-rams that shook the walls as if
an earthquake was rolling by. Ay! on they pressed,
for did not the archangel wave them to the onset?
The foe shrank back amazed. Outwork, and door-post,
and palisade could offer no resistance to the
enthusiasm of the Christians. Vain were the wildest
efforts of the infidels to stay the progress of the assailing
hosts; vain were their adjurations to the
prophet, their impious prayers for help, their insulting
prostrations before high heaven. The hurricane
that levels cities was not more desolating than the
onslaught of the Christians. They dashed across the
plain, they drove in the outposts, they crossed the
ditch itself; and now the tower of Godfrey reached
the walls—the bridge was let down—a rush was
made, and a knight sprang on the battlements. Another
and another followed—the Saracens stood
palsied—Godfrey, Baldwin, Bouillon rushed in—down
went the sacrilegious infidels who opposed
them—a wild conflict, beyond what the battle had
yet seen, took place around the standard of the
crescent; and lo! with a shout that men shall remember
till the day of judgment, the impious ensign
is hurled from the battlements, and the cross—the
cross of Christ—floats wild and free above the
towers of Jerusalem. Then rose up the acclamations
of thousands—then pealed the triumphal chaunts of
priests—then quailed the Saracen with fear in the
remotest dens of that vast city. The day was won.
The cross was avenged. Tancred and Robert of
Normandy heard the triumphal shout, and burst open
the furthermost gates with sudden energy; while
Raimond of Toulouse scaled the walls upon the
other side at the outcry, and shook the cross to the
wind beyond the Holy Sepulchre. Down went the
Saracens in street and lane, and open field, or
wherever these unholy revilers of the church attempted
to make their stand. From house to house, and
street to street, the indignant conquerors pursued
the foe, until the thoroughfares were filled with
blood, and the infidels lay slaughtered in heaps on
every hand; and wherever the Christians followed
up the flying wretches, in mansion or in mosque,
they kept in memory the insult to the cross which
they had witnessed but the hour before, and keeping
it in memory, their arms never tired, nor their
weapons slackened. It was a day over which for
ages the Saracen women wept. The mosque of
Omar floated with gore; the streets were slippery
with blood; not a nook or corner gave safety to one
of that accursed race; and when, at length, the Saracens
rushed in wild despair to the temple of Soliman,
even there the avenging Christians sought them
out, and a thousand, ay! ten times a thousand impious
revilers slaked the earth with their gore.
And when the work was done, and that fearful insult
was avenged; when the conquering army had time
to think of the mighty deed they had achieved;
when they remembered that within the walls where
they now were the Savior had been buried, a gush of
holy tenderness swept over their souls,—old and
young, noble and peasant, men, women, and children,—and
with tears in their eyes, they cast aside
their weapons, took off their sandals, and, rushing to
the Holy Sepulchre, kissed the consecrated pavement,
and washed the altar with their tears. And
when twilight darkened over the city, the vespers of
holy men went up to heaven, for the first time after
the lapse of centuries, instead of the accursed Mezzuin’s
call. Night came down at length, and silence
hung over the walls. The shrieks of the wounded;
the groans of the dying; the crackling of burning
habitations, and the impious revilings of the infidels
had ceased: while not a sound broke the profound
hush of midnight, except the faint gurgling of the
brook of Kedron, and the low whispers of the night
wind among the palaces of Jerusalem. And a thousand
stars looked brilliantly down from the calm
blue sky, as if the angels, whose thrones they are,
were shouting hallelujahs that the last day of the
Saracen had passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The relations of life abound with solemn warnings
and touching incidents. Scarcely a community exists,
however small, the history of which is not replete
with scenes that, if delineated by the pen of a
master spirit, and embellished with a few of the
golden rays of fancy, would not seem fraught with
romance. Nay, there is scarcely a family of any extent
that has not stories in its private chronicles,
“lights and shadows,” joys and sorrows, full of interest,
and calculated, when suitably embellished and
elaborated, to “point a moral or adorn a tale.” We
“live, move and breathe” in a world of mystery.
The shadows which veil a single year—nay, a single
day—from the eye of poor mortality, may to some
be charged with death and desolation, while to others
they may serve to shut out the glorious light of hope
and happiness and prosperity. The incident which
to-day gladdens the heart and kindles the expectation,
may to-morrow prove but as the lightning’s
flash, that foreruns the bolt of the destroyer. Thus
we know not what is best for us, and while seeking
to deserve the due of virtue and integrity, we should
check our own hearts when envying the apparent
success of another, and murmuring at what, to our
imperfect vision, may appear an unequal distribution
of the blessings of Providence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the tone of reflection in which I indulged
a few evenings since, on returning from a
visit to a friend—a friend whose career of honor and
ambition had, but a year or two before, excited a
feeling in the mind somewhat akin to envy. But let
me not anticipate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Laura Milnor, at the age of sixteen, was one of
the loveliest of her sex. Her beauty was girlish
and buoyant, and made up of such elements as youth
and hope and innocence and joy. Her laugh thrilled
upon the ear like the clear voice of a glad child; her
step was elastic and aerial, and although as mirthful
and happy as one who had never known a thought
of grief or a dream of sorrow, she was one of the
most susceptible of her sex, and was melted to tears
almost as readily as she was excited to mirth. Blue
eyes, auburn hair, and a voice full of music—she
was too sensitive for the heartlessness of this world,
and thus it was the fear of those who knew her character
thoroughly, and were well acquainted with
human nature in the aggregate, that she would be
won too readily, and possibly waste the sweetness
of her pure and guileless heart upon an unworthy object.
Not so, however. At seventeen, she was the
“bright, particular star” of her immediate circle,
with groups of admirers, of various grades of merit
and pretension, but with an avowed, preferred and
envied suitor. He had a rival, it is true, and a formidable
one; because, to a considerable fortune he
added a sincerity of devotion and an assiduity of attention
that seldom fail to make an impression upon
the heart of woman, however obdurate. But the
preferred suitor, Morton Markley, was a cousin, and
had been preferred, to a slight degree, from earliest
boyhood. His opportunities for pressing his
suit, moreover, were of the best kind; he was a favorite
with the family generally, and these influences
were potent in determining Laura as to a choice.
Nay, the avowal of preference was scarcely determined
upon by her. It was rather made by the
household circle, and regarded as a thing of
course, than elicited from the artless girl in some
quiet and impassioned moment of mutual confidence.
At times, too, she felt something like a doubt—a
doubt as to the <span class='it'>reality</span> of her attachment to her
cousin. She knew—she <span class='it'>felt</span> that she esteemed him.
He possessed many noble qualities. His habits were
of the kind that her mother approved in an especial
manner. He was not only strictly moral, but temperate
from his earliest youth—a zealot in the cause,
indeed—and withal thoroughly devoted to business.
True, he was somewhat stiff and formal in his manners,
possessed little or no imagination, had no taste
for poetry or pathos, and was somewhat cold in his
general character. In most of these particulars he
afforded a broad contrast to his rival, George St.
Clair, a free, dashing, thoughtless creature, all impulse
and enthusiasm, with a flashing genius and a
heart of fire. But all these qualities were moderated
and subdued in the presence of Laura Milnor. She
had achieved a conquest over his heart, and he yielded
to her every wish, and even often anticipated her
thoughts. But he saw her seldom, comparatively
speaking, and although the impression he made at
such times was decided, it was but momentary.
Laura would occasionally hesitate, especially when
she found the image of St. Clair rising up in her
memory, and she discovered herself analysing his
traits of disposition and manner, and contrasting
them with those of her cousin. But she blushed
when she detected the current of her thoughts, and
turned away from the subject as from one that she
ought not to contemplate. St. Clair, moreover, was
a ripe scholar for his years, perfectly familiar with
the poetry of the classics, and with modern literature.
His practice was to mark the exquisite
passages in his favorite authors, and thus, while
indicating his own sentiments and tone of mind,
to appeal, as it were, to the calm and reflecting
spirit of Laura. How often did she find herself unconsciously
meditating upon these gems of thought—these
eloquent and impassioned pourings out of the
souls of the gifted! How frequently did the brief
but expressive notes touch a chord in her own breast,
and speak in a still, but deep voice to her own spirit!
It was on such occasions that she trembled lest she
had mistaken the feeling that animated her with regard
to her cousin. But then he was so good, so
calm, so attentive! They had grown up side by
side! Her mother, her brother, her elder sister, all
respected him so much—he was so amiable, and his
prospect in life was so excellent! No—it was impossible.
There could not be any mistake as to the
nature of her feelings, and she would consent and
name the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day <span class='it'>was</span> named, and the bridal took place.
The party was large, gay, delightful. I shall never
forget that wedding night. It was one of the happiest
of my existence—a joyous epoch in memory’s
waste, which shines with no common glory as the
mind wanders back and lingers above the regretted
past. Laura, so charming before, seemed to excel
all her former brightness and beauty. Sweet seventeen—the
loveliest of the lovely, glittering in gems
and satin, with her blue eyes brightened with a
double lustre by the excitement of the moment, her
auburn hair waving like a flood of moonbeams upon
her white shoulders: approving relations and friends
around! That indeed seemed a happy moment—the
happiest of her life. But <span class='it'>was</span> it so? Her affianced
also looked remarkably well. He had
thrown off his gravity of manner, his dignity of deportment,
and joined the jest and laugh as if the
world to him also had assumed its sunniest smile.
But I need not describe the etceteras of the wedding.
At twelve o’clock, Mr. and Mrs. Markley were
taken in charge by the usual number of select and
officiating friends, and driven to their own home, a
neat but elegantly furnished establishment, No. 47
—— Row.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was absent from the city two years. On my return,
one of my first visits was to the house of my
old friend Markley. It was a delightful evening in
the month of May, 1836. The weather for the preceding
week had been wet and disagreeable, so that
the change and a bright moon had won hundreds
from their dwellings to enjoy the cool evening
breeze, and gaze once more into the windows of the
stores. I inquired for Mr. Markley. He was not
in. For Mrs. Markley. Her parlor door was thrown
open, and Laura stood before me—but how changed!
She was paler, thinner, and, to my eye, lovelier than
ever. The delicate cast of thought had given an intellectual
aspect to her features. The ruddy glow,
the buoyant, springy motion of girlhood, were no
longer there; but, in the one case, the ripeness of
the peach had been succeeded by the soft tints of the
rose, and in the other, the gazelle-like bound had
mellowed and melted into the more graceful and majestic
movement of the perfect woman. Her reception
was frank and cordial. My visit seemed a relief
to her. She had “been alone for more than an
hour, and had wanted so much to take a stroll. Her
spirits had been checked for the week past by the
gloomy weather, and <span class='it'>now</span>, when they seemed anxious
to spring away, as if on new-born wings, she was
compelled, like a bird in a cage, to remain within
doors. Oh, these abominable meetings! This
dreadful political excitement! These detestable societies!
Would you believe it, Mr. Markley has
not been home a single evening for these two weeks!
He has become a violent politician, and is a member
of several literary and philanthropic societies. These
occupy four-fifths of his time, and although he is one
of the very best husbands in the world, kind, gentle
and affectionate when here, I do not see him except
at meal times, three hours in a fortnight. And here
I sit, ‘moping’ away my young hours, thinking all
sorts of melancholy things, indulging sometimes in
the wildest of fancies, and not unfrequently—although
I am almost ashamed to confess it—killing
the time and giving vent to my moody temper in a
fit of crying! It is of no use to complain to Morton.
He is perfectly mad upon the subject of politics, and
fancies, dear soul, that he is building up for himself
an enviable reputation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed! Until the death of my first-born I
bore it very well, for the little innocent engaged my
attention in a thousand ways, and the time passed
smoothly enough. But since that painful event—nearly
a year ago—the time has hung heavily indeed.
I don’t know what I should do but for our old
friend St. Clair. He calls frequently, and serves no
little to chase away the gloom of these lonely hours.
You remember St. Clair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. I have not met him since the night
of your wedding, and then, poor fellow, he endeavored
to <span class='it'>look</span> and <span class='it'>act</span> his best, but he made a sorry failure
of it. Has he married yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no! He tells me he will never marry, but
of course the hour of temptation and trial is yet to
come. He has changed very little within the last
three years, and although not so gay and reckless as
formerly, his spirits are still excellent. Mr. Markley
prizes him very highly, and frequently consigns
me to his care for a stroll, while he hurries off to
some political club or abominable meeting. Can
you furnish me with any remedy for the sort of infatuation
I have described in the case of Morton? I
am really provoked at him at times, and have ventured
to remonstrate more than once, but never with
a good effect either upon his temper or his conduct.
Oh! how frequently have the lines of the poet risen
to my memory during the tedious hours of waiting
and of watching!</p>

<p class='noindent'>I ridiculed them when they were first pointed out to me
by St. Clair, but sad experience has taught me better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such, in brief, was the nature of the conversation
of the night. I remained until a late hour, exceedingly
anxious to see my old friend, but the clock
struck eleven, and he had not returned. Wandering
homeward, a crowd of strange thoughts pressed
upon my brain. Can he love this gentle being? I
asked. And then his whole course through life came
to my recollection, and I dismissed every doubt.
He does love her to the extent of his ability. Then
why neglect her? Why permit melancholy to prey
upon her gentle spirit? Why subject her to the
fascinations of such a man as St. Clair?—temptations
at which both would shrink with horror at first,
but which, sooner or later, with such a being, such
hearts, such sympathy of soul and of taste, must establish
a bond very like that of love! The subject
was a painful one, and I dismissed it, unwilling to
probe it to the bottom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I visited Laura repeatedly during the subsequent
six months. I became deeply interested in her position,
and more than once ventured to hint, jestingly,
to her husband the duty of watching with a vigilant
eye over so precious and delicate a flower. He appeared
perfectly insensible to all insinuations upon
the subject, and with unbounded confidence in, and
as much attachment for Laura as his nature was capable
of feeling, he became more and more wedded to
his dream of political ambition and popular applause.
He was a member of most of the societies that
were in any degree connected with philanthropy, and
of all on the political side to which he was attached;
and thus, night after night, week after week, and
month after month, he absented himself from the society
of his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But why prolong the story? Hour after hour, the
conviction grew stronger in the mind of Laura that
she had mistaken the sentiments of her husband. He
had, she now believed, never loved her. He had
either deceived her or been himself deceived. It
was clear that he shunned her society, and although
kind and obliging, this course was attributed rather
to his tone of mind and moral principle than to a
warmer and fonder emotion of his heart. She too
had been mistaken. At least she thought so. The
feeling that had induced her to become his wife was
not love; not that deep and absorbing passion, that
flame and fire of the soul, that she now could feel and
appreciate. He was her cousin; she had known him
long; he had ever been kind to her; her parents had
urged her marriage, and she had been misled! But,
alas! how had he deserted her! How had she been
neglected! How cold had he become! How indifferent!
What a contrast to St. Clair!—St. Clair,
who even now would lay down his life for her; who
even now <span class='it'>sought</span> her society, and was never so happy
as when basking in her smile! Her heart thrilled,
her brain throbbed, and her mind almost maddened
as these wild thoughts forced themselves upon her.
I say forced themselves, for she repelled them again
and again, as fiends that would destroy her quiet, sap
her principles, and render her an object of scorn even
to herself. But night after night, and her husband
was still abroad. At first she saw him depart with
pride upon her lip and anguish in her heart. Then
sullenness followed, and indifference came after.
Then a feeling of pleasure tingled in her breast as
the door closed behind him, and a still stronger sensation
was experienced as the well known step of
St. Clair was heard upon the pavement below her
window. But why trace the progress of the weak,
the erring human heart? Why linger over the guilt-ward
progress of that neglected wife? Why harrow
the soul with her struggles between duty on the one
hand and infatuation on the other? Why point to
her fall, as, step by step, she was hurried to the
brink of ruin? Why detail the subtle sophistry of a
gifted spirit—one, too, who had persuaded himself
that he really loved with a pure and undying flame?
Why recount his many appeals to fly to some other
land, some distant shore, where the scorn of the
heartless world could not point at and exult over another
victim? Why picture the secret and agonizing
thoughts of the wretched beauty; the sorrow
that at moments fastened upon her soul, when some
heart-touching expression fell from the lips of her husband,
and she was recalled by a look or a phrase to
her early dream of home and love and happiness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late in the month of September, that, rambling
down Spruce street, my attention was attracted
by an unusual stir and confusion in the front parlor
of my friend Markley’s dwelling. Lights were passing
to and fro with great rapidity, and ever and anon
a shriek, as of one in mortal agony, broke upon the
night. I hurried forward, rapidly ascended the
stairs, and what a scene of horror was before me!
The slight, yet beautiful form of Laura Markley lay
upon the sofa, her hair dishevelled, her clothes in
disorder, and her features pale and cold in the solemn
aspect of death! It was almost midnight;
her husband had been sent for, but had not yet arrived.
Miserable being! Blind and misguided fool!
He came in a few minutes after, and for weeks and
weeks was little better than a maniac. The following
brief note, the last ever penned by Laura, told
the dreadful story:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, Charles! forgive me, if I have
wronged you! I can endure it no longer. Night after
night have you neglected me for the last two years,
until my mind, maddened by doubt, despair, and
a thousand fiendish phantoms, has ventured to pause
and contemplate a deed of guilt! There is, I verily
believe, another being on the face of the earth who
loves me, and I—I—my hand trembles and my
brain reels—I am yet yours, and in honor. But I
fear I could not live, be neglected, and continue so.
Forgive me, heaven!—forgive me, my husband, and
pray for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the West Riding of Yorkshire, not many miles
removed from the line of the great North Road, singularly
and somewhat romantically situated on a
vast rocky hill, projecting sternly and abruptly into
the lovely valley of the Nid, stands the old borough
town of Knaresborough. As you approach it from
the south, the aspect it presents is singularly wild
and picturesque. A long line of steep limestone
crags, running from east to west, limits the view in
front; the river, deep, black and sullen, wheeling
along below their base in many a turbid ripple, until
it skirts their western cape, a huge and perpendicular
crag of shaley limestone, crowned by the massy
relics of an old Norman keep, rifted and gray, and
overrun with immemorial ivy, but still majestic in
their hoary grandeur. Beneath the shelter of this
formidable keep—which, in its day, before the levelling
force of gunpowder had reduced warfare to a
mere matter of scientific calculation, had been deemed
quite impregnable—the straggling country town
climbs the hill-side from the stream’s level, where
the road is carried over a narrow, high-backed bridge
of stone, in one long zigzag street, so perilously slippery
and steep that the most daring riders dismount
from their surest horses, whether ascending or descending,
until, the summit gained, it expands into a
neat borough, with market-place, and hostelries, and
banks, and churches, all overlooked, however, and
commanded by the old castle; and, in its turn, overlooking
and commanding the wide range of hilly
country of which it occupies the extreme and highest
promontory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such is the picture it presents to the traveller of
the present day, and singularly beautiful is that picture!
The huge gray ruins and the stained limestone
precipices, relieved and set off by the deep emerald
verdure of the wide pastures in the valley, and the
dark foliage of the hanging woods which skirt the
margin of the river; the stream itself here dark and
deep and silent, and there flashing like silver in the
sunlight, and brawling noisily about the base of the
great castle-rock; and, more than all, the life and
animated bustle of the modern town, contrasted with
the dim memories and solemn silence of those old
towers, which frown upon the noisy thoroughfares of
men, most like a grim and ghastly skeleton, glaring
down from the gothic niche of some cathedral church
upon the merry sports of thoughtless childhood. Far
different was the scene which Knaresborough presented
toward the middle of the seventeenth century,
Some few weeks later than the fatal field of Marston,
whereon, untimely sacrificed and vainly, by the mad
rashness of Prince Rupert, the flower of England’s
loyal chivalry lay weltering in their gore, for one who
neither prized their faith nor sorrowed at their fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those ruins, shapeless now, and undistinguished
from the gray crags around them, were then a proud
and lordly castle; that huge and rifted pile, that
frowns above the lesser fragments, was the square
dungeon keep, with battlemented turrets at each
aerial angle, and bartizans for shot of arquebuss and
musquetoon, and embrasures for heaviest ordnance;
while round it swept the massy flankers, with thirteen
strong round towers, well garnished with the
lighter cannon of the day, sakers and culverins and
falcons; and without these, still in concentric circles,
half moon and counterscarp and ravelin, glacis
and rock-hewn moat—a mighty fortress for the king,
whose banner, hoisted there by the fugitives from
that disastrous field, still waved defiance to his
foemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a bright October morning with which we
have to do; the sun was pouring a broad flood of
light over the fertile vale, with its green meadowland,
its hanging woods, its ruddy cornfields, and its
bright river; over the town and castle, crowded, this
with fierce steel-clad veterans, mustered beneath the
royal standard, that with the yeomanry and burghers,
like their more regular comrades, in arms for church
and king against the leaguering hosts of Cromwell;
over the camp, the lines, the outposts of the Puritans,
which hemmed the destined town about with, as it
were, a wall of iron. Upon the heights, just to the
eastward of the town, the fierce, enthusiastic Lilburne
had fixed his quarters, and hoisted the broad
red cross of the parliament, and thence, on every
side, had drawn his lines about the borough; the
bridge and the high road, on the south side, were
kept by a brigade of pikes and two strong bands of
horse arquebusiers; the meadows and the vale were
swept by four full regiments of the far-famed invincibles,
the ironsides of Cromwell; the woods were
filled with sharp-shooters, the roads blocked up with
mounds and trenches, and all the north side of the
town exposed to a tremendous fire from fifty wide-mouthed
cannon, which, covered from the castle
guns by a projecting hillock, battered the dwellings
of the hapless burghers without remorse or respite.
Nor were the besieged passive in the mean time, or
fearful. Bright sheets of flame would leap out, ever
and anon, from the dark castle embrasures, and clouds
of snow-white smoke would swathe the giant keep in
their dense vapory shroud, and with a roar that told
the awful tale of civil warfare even to the distant
walls of York, the heavy shot would plunge into the
serried columns of the leaguers, thinning their ranks
indeed, and shaking for a moment their array, but
daunting not their fiery courage, nor damping their
enthusiastic zeal. And now, with the long roll of
drums and the soul-stirring flourish of the horn and
bugle, from this point or from that of the beleaguered
town, the cavaliers would sally out on their besiegers.
Now by some ford of the swift river, neglected because
thought impassable, a little troop of gentlemen,
superbly mounted on high blooded chargers,
fluttering with lace and waving with tall plumes and
blue embroidered scarfs, would dash upon some
picquet of the Puritans, and drive them back, scattered
and broken and cut down, to the main body; and
then, forced to retreat in turn, would fall back foot
by foot, firing their petronels and musquetoons from
every hedge and coppice, and charging again and
again on their pursuers from every spot of vantage,
till they had gained the river; then they would
wheel, throw in one shattering volley, swim through
the eddying waters, and raise their gallant cheer,
“God for King Charles!” in safety. Now it would
be a steadier and sterner effort; a heavy column
would rush out, pikemen and musqueteers and horse
in one dense body, bearing the outposts in at the
pike’s point, carrying some redoubt, and then deploying
in its front, until their pioneers and axemen
should spike its guns, fill up its ditches, and level its
defences to the ground. Incessant were alarms and
panics, sallies and feints and false attacks on the
one hand; and, on the other, strict watches, stout
resistance, guarded and sure approaches, for Lilburne
knew right well the quality of his own troops—the
nature of the force opposed to him. He had experienced
often in the field the fiery and resistless
charges of the impetuous cavaliers; he knew that in
the stoutest veterans of the Parliament, none could
be found who, for a single dash, could cope with the
high-born and chivalrous adherents of the King; but
he knew also that undisciplined and fiery gentlemen,
how gallant and how desperate soever, would not endure
the tedium of protracted operations, the dull
monotony of a long siege, where passive opposition
only can be offered, the lack of wine and the appliances
of mirth, the scarcity of food, the daily sufferings,
the daily waste, the daily growing anguish.
He knew, and acted on this knowledge. Vastly superior
in his numbers, he cared not for the loss of a
picquet; he shook not at the defeat of an outpost, the
destruction of a redoubt, or the success of a sally.
If evening saw the line of his circumvallation broken,
the morning sun beheld his working parties on the
ground repairing the defences, protected by so powerful
masses that any sally must be fruitless to annoy
them, and evening found the lines again complete,
but stronger, nearer, closer than before. Nor
was this all. With his strong cavalry, he kept the
country round in constant terror and excitement; he
cut off every convoy, before it well had left the place
from which it started; he surprised every stronghold
of the cavaliers, at miles away from his scene of operations;
he took and garrisoned the loyal house of
Ripley; he battered Spofforth Castle, the old, time-honored
dwelling of the Percies; he quelled the
risings of the Langdales, the Vavasours, the Slingsbys
and the Stourtons. He indeed bridled the bold
valor of the West Riding, as he had boasted that he
would—bridled it with a curb of iron!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Knaresborough still held out!—castle and
town held out, though worn and wasted with fatigue
and famine. Hastily had the brave defenders thrown
themselves into that stronghold, scantily victualled
as it was, expecting succors from without, as it were,
every hour, and prepared desperately to endure the
utmost before submission to their hated foes. Hastily,
rashly had they suffered themselves to be hemmed
in, without a hope except to die, and desperately
had they borne up against the tortures which had rewarded
that hot rashness. And now the moment had
arrived. For three whole days, the castle and the
town had had no food at all! All stores had, many
days since, been exhausted; the very grass that
grew upon the ramparts had been all gathered, all
consumed! The beasts of burthen, the domestic animals,
the very vermin, had been sought eagerly for
food—had been devoured greedily—till no more
could be found at all in that most miserable town.
There was not one house but had lost some of its inmates,
by that most lingering, most terrible of
deaths, mere famine!—and it was on the youngest,
the fairest, the loveliest, the most beloved, that the
dread doom fell first. The streets were heaped with
carcasses, for now the living lacked the strength, the
energy, to bury their own dead! Thrice had the
burghers risen against the castle, to force its commandant,
by surrendering to the Puritans, to free
them from that lamentable durance; and thrice had
the gray-headed cavalier, who held that last stronghold
for an unthankful monarch—while the tears
streamed hot and heavy down his emaciated cheeks,
and his heart throbbed as if it would burst his bosom,
for very pity—ordered the castle guns to play with
grape upon the famished wretches, whose despair
would have forced him from his duty. Three times,
repulsed from the castle by their friends, had that
most hapless populace rushed out to the besieger’s
camp, throwing themselves upon the mercy of their
foes, and hoping so to force their way into the open
country, and three times, at pike’s point, had they
been driven back into that town of sepulchres and
charnel houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the third day that no particle of food, except
some scraps of leather, roasted or sodden into
soup, had passed the lips of any of the garrison, on
which a sad deputation of the townsmen waited for
the fourth time upon the captain of the castle. They
came not now in turbulence, hoping to <span class='it'>force</span> submission,
but tearfully and on their bended knees, to beg
that stern old veteran, as they deemed him, that for
the love of God, by all his hopes of Heaven, he would
have mercy <span class='it'>not</span> on them, they said, “for we are men,
and can endure the utmost, but for our wives, our
perishing wives and children!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friends,” he answered, “I feel for you—God
is my judge I do!—and here, here is my witness
that none hath heavier cause to feel than I
have,” and as he spoke, he opened the door of an inner
chamber, and showed to those worn deputies the
corpse of a fair, light-haired youth, stretched on a
pallet bed, emaciated beyond all conception—yea!
literally wasted to the bones! “Look there!” he
said, “look there! Six little days ago that famished,
cold, dead carcass was the most fair, the sprightliest,
the bravest, the best, the noblest boy in all
wide England! You see him, as he lies there—<span class='it'>my</span>
boy, my glorious boy!—oh, God! last pledge of my
lost angel, who, dying, left him to my paternal care,
which here is proved forever! Gentlemen, ye are
answered; when my King’s orders reach me to yield
up this hold, then will I yield it up—’till then,
please God, I shall maintain it; and so long as my
trusty fellows have boots, and sword belts, and buff
jerkins, we shall not lack a meal. So, my friends,
fare ye well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this there was no answer; from this lay no appeal.
They went away, as they had come, despairing;
they betook themselves to their inhospitable
homes, to their wan, starving families, and sat them
down beside their fireless hearths, to pray for resignation,
and for death to put an end to tortures which
were fast becoming too terrible to bear. So the
bright hours of daylight rolled over them unheeded,
and the dark night came on—that season of repose
and quiet, season of respite from all cares, relief
from every wo—yet brought it no repose, no respite
to the mourners of that city! The groans of manly
agony, blent with the wailings of expiring infancy,
and the faint sobs of women, suppressing their own
agonies lest they should rend the hearts of others,
went up that livelong night to Heaven; and there
were humble prayers breathed out from penitent
Christian bosoms; and there were wild, impatient,
fierce ejaculations, which those who uttered them
<span class='it'>called</span> prayer; and there were desperate blasphemies
and curses, such as fiends howl out against the throne
of grace, too fearful to be written!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a low chamber of a lonely dwelling, close to the
outposts of the enemy—looking down, indeed, upon
the glacis and the dry moat of the town—there sat
an aged man, shivering above the last expiring embers
of his last brand—it was the last small fragment
of the door, that dying brand! All else, the
floor, the furniture, the casements, had been consumed
already. Upon the hearth, beside the embers,
there stood a mug of water, and a large dish, covered
with thrice gnawed bones, part of a horse’s ribs,
clean picked and broken, so as to reach the marrow.
He was a tall and stately figure, was that aged man,
and he had been strong, sinewy and vigorous even in
his old age; but now his form was bent and all his
limbs contracted; the skin, yellow as parchment,
was drawn tight across his withered brow; his nose
was terribly, unnaturally sharpened, like the nose of
a corpse; his eye was dim and lustreless; his ashy
lips were glued together with a thin frothy slaver.
Yet he had fought that morning in a fierce skirmish,
which had well-nigh brought in a drove of cattle,
and had been only driven back by a charge of the
ironsides, a troop of which, commanded, too, by his
own son, had fallen upon their flank, and borne them
back into the town when confident of victory and full
of high anticipation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His corslet and buff coat were not yet laid aside;
his plumed hat was cast listlessly beside him on the
ground, but his blue baldric still sustained his rapier,
spotted with many blood gouts, and, in the buff belt
round his waist, his pistols, with the hammers down
and the pans black with smoke, showed that he had
not removed them since he had thrust them back into
his girdle, just fired in the heat of action. There he
sat, with his hands clenched and his teeth hard set,
<span class='it'>silent</span>, yet cursing in his heart that recreant son,
whom he had never forgiven—no! never for one moment’s
space!—that he had joined the Parliament
against the King, and on whose head he now invoked
the direst of calamities, that, by his too successful
charge, he had cut off the last relief from that sad
starving city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly a faint sound fell on his ear, as of one
clambering up the glacis. The old man listened,
acutely, breathlessly, as though life were dependant
on his sense of hearing!—again it came, clearer and
louder, <span class='it'>nearer</span> than before. Sword in hand, on the
instant the veteran sprang to the narrow casement
which overlooked the moat and glacis, and there,
scarce three feet from the window, in the steel cap
and corslet, the scarlet cassock and unshapely boots
of Cromwell’s Ironsides, stood a tall, slender figure.
The moon, which was dimly wading through the uncertain
clouds, feebly defined the outlines of his form,
and half revealed, as the old man fancied, the shapes
and weapons of a score or two of his fanatical companions
in the dark hollow of the moat below him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Treason—to arms—ho! treason!”—shouted
the wretched father, at the utmost pitch of his querulous
attenuated voice; but ere he had well syllabled
the words, a faint and well-remembered sound
responded to his high pitched clamor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hist!—Father,”—it said—“Father—it is I—I
have brought hither food and wine, at great risk of
my life—approach, quick! quick! and take them;
I will return to-morrow and crave thy blessing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out on thee! Dog and traitor—die in thy treason,
and thy gifts perish with thee!—Ho! treason!
to arms! treason!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the cry reached wakeful ears, and was
again repeated and again—“Ho! treason! to arms!
treason!”—and lights were seen flashing along the
ramparts, and trumpets were blown through the
streets, and sentinels were heard continually challenging,
and hasty footsteps, and the clash of arms,
drew nearer every moment; and still that aged man,
implacable, and steeled against his son by bitter
hate, shouted, “to arms! to arms!” and called the
hue and cry that way with frantic energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not be so balked—thou wilt repent this,
father,” said the young man, advancing nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray God I live to see thee hanged; I will repent
this never!—approach me not, or I will rob the
hangman of his due, and with mine own hand slay
thee!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou wilt not, father,” replied the other, as he
laid his hand on the casement, and reaching into the
chamber, set down upon the floor a small rush basket,
and a tall flask of wine,—“thou wilt not, father—seeing
that I have risked my life to bring thee meat
and wine. I knew not, till to-day, that thou wert in
this lamentable town!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the old man listened, and seemed even
somewhat mollified, but as his son alluded to the situation
of the town, all his old rage returned, and with
the words, “die dog!” he lunged full at his heart
with his drawn rapier—the blow took effect, full on
the polished corslet, and glanced off, inflicting a
deep wound on his left arm, and hurling him to the
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! have I slain thee?—Ha! so perish all the
enemies of good king Charles!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Praised be God,” replied the Puritan, “praised
be God, <span class='it'>that</span> sin is spared to thee—farewell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho! guard—this way,” shouted the veteran,
now more incensed than ever, “ho! guard—this
way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with their arquebusses lowered, and their
slow-matches lighted, a party of the night-watch
rushed in from the street—the ruthless father pointed
them to the figure of his flying son, and a quick
volley followed—another—and another!—and all
along the ramparts, from every battlement and
crenelle, the sharp, clear flashes of the random musquetry
streamed out into the midnight darkness—and
the loud rattle of the shots startled the sentinels
of Lilburne on their posts, and set the outposts and
picquets on the alert throughout the whole of the beleaguering
hosts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Escaping from the random volleys, the young man
hurried to his quarters; but ere he reached them, he
was met by the grand rounds, interrogated, seized,
dragged to head-quarters, tried for communicating
with the enemy by a drum-head court-martial, and
sentenced to be hanged upon the morrow, between the
glacis and the lines—before two hours had passed.
Meantime the old man <span class='it'>fed</span>—<span class='it'>coolly fed</span> on the meat,
and quaffed the wine his child—his betrayed child—had
brought to him—then mocked the throne of
mercy with a prayer, and lay down, and slept soundly—while
that same child, watched in a military
dungeon, and prayed for mercy to his soul, which
must be with its God, to-morrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morrow dawned, and the accursed gallows
stood there erect between the glacis and the lines—and
the death-drums were beating through the
camp—and the Parliamentarians mustered to punishment
parade, with their war weapons trailed,
and their grim visages suffused with more than their
accustomed gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fearful tale was known—at once, almost instinctively
it was revealed—all means were taken,
and all methods tried to preserve the victim son—threats
of retaliation—proffers of terms—entreaties—ransom—bribes—but
all were tried in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the full blaze of noon, before the besieged town,
before the besieging army, before men, angels, God—the
son died on the gallows tree, victim of filial
piety—martyr to military discipline—and the old
ruthless man, who had consigned his own child to
that fearful doom, looked on, and strove to smile,
and would have braved it out even to the end—but
the offended majesty of nature stood forth in its
dread might!—the fierce revulsion of conflicting
passions conquered the wretched clay!—with the
sneer on his lip, and the bold evil words upon his
tongue—he staggered—fell!—they lifted him, but
he was dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, a courier with a white flag paused at
the outposts of the Roundheads. It was a messenger
from Charles, licensing his commander to surrender
his good and faithful town of Knaresborough—and
the next day the garrison marched out with colors
flying and drums beating, and all the honors of war
granted them,—and filed in their superb array beneath
the gibbet and the corpse of him who died a
felon’s death, for succoring a father at his need!—Ho!
the morality of warfare! The glory of the
victor!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A LEGEND OF THE HARTZ MOUNTAINS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolution, father, for breath is fleeting fast,”
cried the dying man, in a scarce audible voice. As
the monk approached the bed, the sick man started
from his pillow, and, with clenched hands and straining
eyes, uttered, in a low, sepulchral tone, “Avaunt!
avaunt, thou damning fiend! thine hour is not yet
come. Oh, mercy! mercy!” His bosom heaved
convulsively, the dew of agony gathered thick upon
his brow, and, with a beseeching look, he pointed to
the crucifix on the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confession alone can save you, my son. While
there is yet time, relieve your bosom of its load of
sin, and seek for pardon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Too late!</span> oh, lost forever! The hour approaches;
come near.” Drawing from under his pillow a
parchment, he placed it in the hands of the monk.
“My confession, father; <span class='it'>now</span>, now, sign me with
the cross.” Uttering a wild cry of anguish, the dying
man, with desperate energy, flung himself towards
the monk, and attempted to grasp the symbol of salvation.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A vivid, lurid gleam, followed by an
astounding crash, mingled with horrid yells and
piercing screams! When the monk was found by a
lay brother, he still breathed, but unconscious of external
objects, from which state he never recovered;
the bed was empty, and the bedclothes lay in wild
disorder, as if torn by a mighty struggle. In the
hand of the prostrate monk was found a manuscript:</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE CONFESSION OF THE LOST.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the confines of the Hartz Mountains, in a
lowly hut, I first saw the light. My mother yielded
up her life in giving me birth, and the nourishment
of a pet goat sustained the feeble spark of infancy.
My remaining parent proved, though rough and uncultivated,
a kind nurse. The hours of childhood
were passed in assisting my father in collecting dried
wood for burning charcoal, and oft, as I penetrated
through the tangled forest, would I stand and gaze
upon the clear blue flame that night after night arose
from one of the highest peaks, and though an ague
would creep over me at the recollection of some of
the tales of horror that clothed those mountains in
such fearful dread, still an unconquerable desire to
witness their midnight orgies grew with my growth
and strengthened with my strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About two hundred feet from the base of the loftiest
of that extended chain of mountains, jutted out a perpendicular
rock. Upon the summit stood the castle
of Rudolfo, whose weather-beaten battlements had
for ages frowned defiance upon the plain below.
Dark hints and mysterious whispers surrounded that
isolated spot with gloom and fear; no footsteps ever
approached its portals after sundown, and an Ave
Maria was silently, though fervently breathed, when
the benighted hunter or weary traveller caught a
glimpse of the solitary light that was ever seen in one
of the casements of the castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Count Rudolph was a man of valor; his arm was
held invincible in the battle field; but of a temperament
morose and savage, his vassals quailed beneath
the glance of his bright gray eye, and trembled when
the sound of his loud clear voice rang through the
vaulted halls. Among the dependants that sat at his
board below the salt, or rallied around his banner,
were hearts that thirsted to bury their daggers in his
blood; but the mantle of superstitious mystery so
completely enveloped him, that the hand, however
daring, shrunk from the murderous deed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The iron-bound features of Count Rudolph never
relaxed, save when his looks rested upon his daughter.
Then would the contracted brow expand, and
those eyes so formidable emit a ray of feeling. He
seldom smiled, but the effect was startling; a meteor,
dazzling by its brightness, to render the darkness
more visible. And that daughter was a glorious creature!
The tall, graceful form, the dark hazel eyes,
commanded the allegiance of all that looked upon her.
To her father her features bore a strong resemblance,
but moulded in the most perfect female softness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady Auzella was seldom seen beyond the
boundaries of the castle, but the report of her wondrous
beauty had spread far over Germany, and many
a valiant knight had sued in vain for her fair hand,
notwithstanding the vague and strange reports that
were ever afloat about Count Rudolph and his unhallowed
deeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was my twentieth birthday. The hours of labor
were exchanged for hunting, a pastime of which I
was most fond. So intent was I in chasing the chamois
and hungry wolves that infest those regions, I
thought not of the departure of day, until warned by
the declining sun shedding its golden rays through
the “forest’s thickening gloom.” An unconquerable
feeling of dread at being thus benighted, caused me
to hasten my footsteps towards my humble cot.
With a steady eye and nervous limbs, I bounded over
the impetuous stream that rolls down the mountain
side, and springing from crag to crag, I emerged from
the dense shadow of trees, and stood upon a platform
of rock overgrown with moss and stunted oak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Involuntarily I lingered to gaze upon the scene before
me. The whole country glowed with the effulgence
of the setting sun, whilst the amphitheatre of
hills that bounded the horizon was clothed in gorgeous
purple. On the right stood the castle, its turrets
and towers catching the lingering sunbeams,
bringing them out in bold relief from the mass of
frowning mountains that formed the back ground.
The only sound that broke upon the ear was the incessant
roar of the cataract. Whilst thus I stood
entranced, a strain of music suddenly burst through
the air, so wild, so melodious, that it seemed an echo
from the spheres. Amazed, I listened breathlessly;
again the same sweet notes were borne upon the gentle
gales. I turned, when lo! beside the rushing
torrent sat a female; her long tresses were floating
upon the breeze, and revealed the features of the
Lady Auzella! Ere the melting strains were ended
that had held bound my soul, shrieking, affrighted,
she fled towards me. With horror I beheld a huge
bear spring from the overhanging crag, and stand
within a foot of his prey. In one moment I took a
sure and deadly aim—fired—the monster rolled head-long
down the rapid stream; the next instant the
fainting form of Auzella reposed within my arms!
My fate was sealed; the past, the future, all, all
were forgotten. We met again and again; I loved,
ardently, madly, and was beloved! Yes! the high-born,
haughty damsel loved the humble youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We lived in the spring-time of love; the cold, bleak
winds of autumn had not yet chilled our hearts, when,
with the impassioned fervor of affection, I besought
the gentle Auzella to fly with me to other lands, where
with my sword I would carve for myself a name worthy
for her to share. Silently she listened, then
raising her head from my bosom, fixed her expressive
eyes upon me, and whispered, as soft as a
zephyr’s sigh—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hast thou dear Carl, resolution to win fame and
wealth, and, with my father’s consent, this hand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try me, beloved, and thou wilt find no braggart
in thy lover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, by thy vows of love, ere ‘yon moon fills
her horn,’ pluck from the mountain’s blazing pile a
firebrand; bear it with all speed to my father’s feet,
and by that token fearlessly claim the hand of Auzella!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ceased, and fled from me. In that brief space
a new existence burst upon my senses. The voice of
love had pointed out the way to the possession of
<span class='it'>gold</span> and the hand of her whom I adored; but how?
To league myself with devils! A cold shudder crept
over me; within my breast raged a fearful struggle.
It passed away, and, with the purpose of my
soul determined, I awoke from the <span class='it'>dream</span> of life to
the reality of existence.</p>

<hr class='tbk114'/>

<p class='pindent'>Strange, that man should shrink in after years from
lifting the veil that has shadowed crimes recklessly
committed in youth. Does he scorn and bid defiance
to the eyes of Omnipotence, and tremble at the
opinions of his fellow worms? How incongruous, but
alas! how true!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although years have rolled past—and time, as it
has flown onward, has hurried with them into the vast
abyss of eternity, pleasures, sins and sorrows—the
events of that <span class='it'>fearful</span> night, that fatal hour, are concentrated
in one burning spot within my brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like king Midas, the cravings of discontent proved
my destruction. Destruction! aye, one endless chain
of wretchedness, perpetuated through life, with no
oblivion in the <span class='it'>grave</span>.</p>

<hr class='tbk115'/>

<p class='pindent'>With desperate energy I braved the lightning’s
lurid gleam, and heeded not the tempest that raged
around me. As I bent my footsteps towards the
ever-burning flame, sounds, as if from the abyss of
Hades, burst upon my ear. I stood palsied with horror,
and as a bright flash burst through the gloom,
shrieks and wild laughter rang through the air, and
revealed my presence! “Ah! standest thou there
to mock me, thou fiend, thou devil? Hurl not reason
<span class='it'>yet</span> from its tottering throne! Begone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hour was past, the trophy <span class='it'>gained</span>, my bride
<span class='it'>won</span>; but an <span class='it'>oath</span> was taken that is engraved upon
my heart with a firebrand, and ever thrills my frame
with anguish—with never-ceasing torture!</p>

<p class='pindent'>How shall I unravel the tangled thread of my after
life? Shall I dwell upon the hour that called Auzella
<span class='it'>mine</span>?—the joy I felt as I clasped my beautiful,
my adored <span class='it'>wife</span> to my heart, notwithstanding the
dark flash from Count Rudolph’s eyes? A brief state
of happiness was mine—an oasis in the wilderness
of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I <span class='it'>now</span> had gold unbounded. We left the frowning
castle for the gay metropolis. The mountain boy
was no longer the shy boor, but the wealthy <span class='it'>noble</span>
and the crafty man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once launched upon the ocean of dissipation, I
trimmed my sails to catch the breeze of pleasure, and
thought not of the whirlpools that surrounded me;
when, one night, in the midst of a gay revel, whilst
the sparkling cup and the merry jest passed freely
round the festive board, a touch of <span class='it'>fire</span>, a whisper
which penetrated my very soul, reminded me of my
<span class='it'>oath</span>—that <span class='it'>fearful oath</span>! Then fled the scene of
enchantment, the faces of beauty, the chrystal lights,
and the music, breathing its soft strains through the
fragrant air; and, in the mind’s eye, the burning
mountain, the horrid yells of demoniacal laughter,
were beheld with frightful distinctness.</p>

<hr class='tbk116'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Murder my friend!</span>—the companion of my midnight
revels, the sharer of my pleasures—<span class='it'>never!</span>
But thine oath! Ah! then did I feel the serpent’s
sting; his envenomed coil compressed every fibre of
my defenceless body; no escape from his toils. I
had voluntarily <span class='it'>sold myself</span> to the demon of the burning
mountain!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out upon it! why quakes this feeble frame as the
hour approaches when I shall “throw off this mortal
coil?” Can tortures be greater than what I do and
<span class='it'>ever will</span> suffer? Why not snap asunder the cord at
once?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the deed was <span class='it'>done</span>, and <span class='it'>then</span> deeper did I
plunge into the vortex of vice, for the slight barrier of
conscience was broken down, and I moved through
the gazing crowd an envied man. Ah, ah, envied!
How little dreamed the gaping fools of the livid spot
<span class='it'>within</span>. But, amidst the volcano that was consuming
me, burned one pure flame—the shrine on which it
was kindled was still unpolluted—my love for
Auzella. She was my day-star, my dream of all that
was pure. Her smile would chase the demon from
my breast, and lull me into forgetfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the cup of misery that I had tasted was not yet
drained. Jealousy mingled with its bitter dregs, and
poisoned my blood and shot through every vein.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly there appeared among us a youth of
striking mien and of great beauty, though of a wild
and singular aspect. He was ever with Auzella! I
chased from my breast the dark thoughts that would
sometimes enter. With the madness of despair, I
bore her to the gloomy castle where dwelt her father.
She murmured not at thus being torn from scenes of
festive mirth to hours of dreary sadness; her eyes
still sparkled with their wonted fire. We visited the
spot where first I dared breathe my aspiring hopes,
and as I folded her to my breast again, I told her
how dear she still was to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Count Rudolph had become more morose, and seldom
went beyond the castle walls. He seemed to
take no pleasure in the presence of his child, and
when I encountered the glance of his eye fixed upon
me, a strange, undefinable sensation would creep over
me: a vague recollection of scenes gone by. Thus
passed four long, weary weeks. For me were no
dreams of the future, no surveying of the past; all,
all was a chaos of guilt and dread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twice, in the still hour of midnight, did I miss Auzella
from my side. At first I heeded it not, but as
thought pressed upon thought, my brain became maddened;
horrible suspicions crept over me. Grasping
my pistols, I fled from the castle, and, without one
definite object, I strode hastily towards <span class='it'>that</span> fatal
spot. The same wild yells met my ear, and, by the
clear blue flame, I beheld a scene of sickening horror!—while
I think upon it, my brain becomes frenzied—but
I must relieve the tortures of this breast
by tracing my sum of misery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aye! I beheld a motley group sitting around the
fire, who, with shouts of laughter and demoniacal
gestures, were tearing asunder a human frame, a
fresh victim! There was a pause, when a voice
arose upon the stillness that sent my blood curdling
to my heart; I looked, and saw <span class='it'>my wife</span>, and by her
side that stranger youth! Slowly I moved my hand
towards my pistol, and, setting my teeth, grasped it
firmly. Another voice rang through the air, and
there sat Count Rudolph, the demon of the burning
mountain; well did I remember, by that light, those
unhallowed eyes and <span class='it'>that smile</span>. The glance was but
momentary, for revenge was heaving my bosom almost
to bursting. There sat the only object on earth
that was dear to me; for <span class='it'>her</span> I had bartered my <span class='it'>soul</span>,
and there she was, in seeming fellowship with devils.
Ages of misery were crowded in that moment. She
turned, and smiled upon the beardless boy. Nature
could endure no longer—I fired! Loud yells and
horrid imprecations mingled with the thunder’s roar;
one fierce scream was borne upon the blast, and, from
the spot where sat Auzella, up rose a <span class='it'>vulture</span>! For
a moment she hovered near me; I saw the crimson
blood stream from its breast, and casting a look upon
me, (which, by day and night, haunts the deepest
spot in memory’s waste,) flapped her broad wings,
and was soon lost in the impenetrable gloom.</p>

<hr class='tbk117'/>

<p class='pindent'>Darkness fell upon me; reason was lost amid the
breakers of despair. A wreck, deserted by Hope,
within my heart is the torch of anguish, kindled at
the funeral pile of <span class='sc'>Vice</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A FROLIC AMONG THE LAWYERS.—A SCENE FROM LIFE.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY T. W. THOMAS, AUTHOR OF “HOWARD PINCKNEY,” ETC.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was born in New Orleans. I had very bad health
there in my early childhood, and “My Aunt Betsey,”
of whom I have before spoken, took a voyage by sea
from Baltimore to the “crescent city,” for the purpose
of returning with me to a climate which the physicians
had said would strengthen my constitution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She brought me up with the greatest kindness, or
rather, I should say she kept me comparatively feeble
by her over-care of my health. When I was about
fourteen years of age, my father brought my mother
and my little sister Virginia on from New Orleans to
see me. My meeting with my kind mother I shall
never forget. She held me at arms’ length for an instant,
to see if she could recognise, in the chubby,
healthy boy before her, the puny, sickly child with
whom she had parted with such fond regret on board
the Carolina, but a few years before; and when, in
memory and in heart, she recognized each lineament,
she clasped me to her bosom with a wild hysteric joy
which compensated her, more than compensated her,
she said, for all the agony which our separation had
caused her. I loved my mother devotedly, yet I wondered
at the emotion which she exhibited at our meeting,
and, child though I was, a sense of unworthiness
came over me, possibly because my affections could
not sound the depths of hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My father’s recognition was kinder than I had expected,
from what I remembered of our parting in
New Orleans. He felt prouder of me than at our parting,
I presume, from my improved health and looks,
and this made him feel that my being tied to the
apron strings of my good old aunt would not improve
my manliness. A gentleman whom he had met at a
dinner party, who was the principal of an academy, a
kind of miniature college, some thirty miles from
Baltimore, had impressed my father, by his disquisitions,
with a profound respect for such a mode of education.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“William,” said my father, in speaking on the
subject to Mr. Stetson, “will be better there than
here among the women; he’ll be a baby forever here.
No, I must make a man of him. I shall take him
next week with me, and leave him in the charge of
Mr. Sears.” My mother insisted upon it that I should
stay awhile longer, that she might enjoy my society,
and that my sister and myself might become attached
to each other ere they returned to New Orleans. But
my father said, “No, my dear; you know it was always
agreed between us that you should bring up Virginia
as you pleased, and that I would bring up William
as I pleased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us take him, then, back to New Orleans,” exclaimed
my mother; “he is healthy enough now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he would not be healthy long there, my dear.
No, I have made inquiry: Mr. Sears is an admirable
man, and under his care, which I am satisfied will be
paternal, William will improve in mind, and learn to
be a man—will you not, William?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could only cling to my mother without reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” exclaimed my father, exultingly, “you
see the effect of his education thus far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The effect of his education thus far!” retorted
my aunt Betsey, who did not relish my father’s remark;
“he has been taught to say his prayers, and
to love his parents and tell the truth. You see the effects
in him now,” and she pointed to me, seated on a
stool by my mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this made no impression upon my father. He
was resolved that I should go to Belle Air, the county
town, situated twenty-five miles from Baltimore,
where the school was, the next week, and he so expressed
himself decidedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The condemned criminal, who counts the hours
that speed to his execution, scarcely feels more horror
at the rush of time than did I. One appalling
<span class='it'>now</span> seemed to possess me. I was deeply sensitive,
and the dread of my loneliness away from all I loved,
and the fear of the ridicule and tyranny of the oldsters,
haunted me so that I could not sleep, and I have lain
awake all night, picturing to myself what would be
the misery of my situation at Belle Air. In fact,
when the day arrived, I bade my mother, aunt Betsey
and my little sister Virginia farewell with scarcely a
consciousness, and was placed in the gig by my father
as the stunned criminal is assisted into the fatal cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This over-sensitiveness—what a curse it is! I
lay no claims to genius, and yet I have often thought
it hard that I should have the quality which makes
the “fatal gift” so dangerous, and not the gift. My
little sister Virginia, who had been my playmate for
weeks, cried bitterly when I left her. I dwelt upon
her swimming eye with mine, tearless and stony as
death. The waters of bitterness had gathered around
my heart, but had not yet found an outlet from their
icy thrall, ’neath which they flowed dark and deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belle Air, at the time I write of, was a little village
of some twenty-five or more houses, six of which
were taverns. It was and is a county town, and court
was regularly held there, to which the Baltimore
lawyers used to flock in crowds; and many mad
pranks have I known them play there for their own
amusement, if not for the edification of the pupils of
Mr. Sears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My father drew up at Mr. Kenny’s tavern, and as it
was about twelve when we arrived, and the pupils
were dismissed to dinner, he sent his card to the principal,
who in a few minutes made his appearance.
Talk of a lover watching the movements and having
impressed upon his memory the image of her whom
he loveth!—the schoolboy has a much more vivid recollection
of his teacher. Mr. Sears was a tall, stout
man, with broad stooping shoulders, he carried a
large cane, and his step was as decided as ever was
Doctor Busby’s, who would not take his hat off when
the king visited his school, for the reason, as he told
his majesty afterwards, that if his scholars thought
that there was a greater man in the kingdom than
himself, he never could control them. The face of
Mr. Sears resembled much the likeness of Alexander
Hamilton, though his features were more contracted,
and his forehead had nothing like the expansion of the
great statesman; yet it projected very similarly at
the brows. He welcomed my father to the village
with great courtesy, and me to his pupilage with
greater dignity. He dined with my father, with me
by his side, and every now and then he would pat me
on the head and ask me a question. I stammered out
monosyllabic answers, when the gentleman would address
himself again to his plate with renewed gusto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Sears recommended my father to board me at
the house of a Mr. Hall, who had formerly been the
sheriff of the county, and whose wife and daughters,
he said, were very fine women. He repented, he said,
when he first took charge of the academy, that there
was not some general place attached to it where the
pupils could board in common, but after reflection
had taught him that to board them about among the
towns-people would be as well. He remarked that I
was one of his smallest pupils, but that he could look
on me <span class='it'>in loco parentis</span>, and doubted not that he could
make a man of me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner he escorted my father, leading me by
the hand, down to the academy, which was on the
outskirts of the town, at the other end of it from Mr.
Kenny’s. The buzz, which the usher had not the
power to control in the absence of Mr. Sears, hushed
instantly in his presence, and as he entered with my
father, the pupils all arose, and remained standing
until he ordered them to be seated. Giving my father
a seat, and placing me in the one which he designed
for me in the school, Mr. Sears called several of his
most proficient scholars in the different classes, from
Homer down to the elements of English, and examined
them. When a boy blundered, he darted at
him a look which made him shake in his shoes, and
when another boy gave a correct answer and took
his fellow’s place, and glanced up for Mr. Sears’
smile, it was a picture which my friend Beard, of
Cincinnati, would delight to draw. The blunderer
looked like one caught in the act of sheep-stealing,
while the successful pupil took his place with an air
that would have marked one of Napoleon’s doubtful
soldiers, when the Emperor had witnessed an act of
daring on his part. As for Mr. Sears, he thought Napoleon
a common creature to himself. To kill men,
he used to say, was much more easy than to instruct
them, he felt himself to be like one of the philosophers
of old in his academy; and he considered Doctor
Parr and Doctor Busby, who boasted that they had
whipped every distinguished man in the country, much
greater than he of Pharsalia or he of Austerlitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the rehearsal of several classes had given
my father a due impression of Mr. Sears’ great gifts
as an instructor, and of his scholars’ proficiency, he
took my father to Mr. Hall’s, to introduce us to my
future host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We found the family seated in the long room in
which their boarders dined. To Mr. Sears they paid
the most profound respect. Well they might, for
without his recommendation they would have been
without boarders. Hall was a tall, good humored,
careless man. His wife was older than himself, tall
too, but full of energy. He had two daughters, Harriet
and Jane. Harriet was a quick, active, lively
girl, and withal pretty, while Jane was lolling and
lazy in her motions, and without either good looks or
prettiness. The matter of my boarding was soon arranged,
and it had become time for my father to depart.
All this while the variety and excitement of
the scene had somewhat relieved my feelings, but
when my father bade me be a good boy and drove off,
I felt as if the “last link” was indeed broken, and
though I made every effort, from a sense of shame,
to repress my tears, it was in vain, and they broke
forth the wilder from their previous restraint. Harriet
Hall came up instantly to comfort me. She took
a seat beside me at the open window at which I was
looking out after my father, and with a sweet voice,
whose tones are in my memory yet, she told me not
to grieve because I was from my friends; that I
should soon see them again, and that she would think
I feared they would not be kind to me if I showed so
much sorrow. This last remark touched me, and
while I was drying my eyes, one of the larger boys,
a youth of eighteen or twenty, came up to the window—for
the academy by this time had been dismissed
for the evening—and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Miss Harriet, is this another baby who is
crying for home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an instant my eyes were dried. I cast one
glance at the speaker—he was a tall, slim, reckless
looking fellow, named Prettyman—and from that
day to this I have neither forgotten it, nor, I fear,
forgiven him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the night, when we retired to our rooms, I found
that my bed was in a room with two others, Prettyman
and a country bumpkin, by the name of Muzzy.
As usual on going to bed, I kneeled down to say my
prayers, putting my hands up in the attitude of supplication.
I had scarcely uttered to myself the first
words, “Our Father,” but to the ear that heareth all
things, when Prettyman exclaimed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s praying! ‘By the Apostle Paul!’ as Richard
the Third says, that’s against rules. Suppose we cob
him, Muzzy?” Muzzy laughed, and got into bed;
and I am ashamed to say that I arose with the
prayer dying away from my thoughts, and indignation
and shame usurping them, and sneaked into bed,
where I said my prayers in silence, and wept myself
in silence to sleep. In the morning, with a heavy
heart, and none but the kind Harriet to comfort me,
I betook myself to the academy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parents little know what a sensitive child suffers
at a public school. I verily believe that these schools
engender often more treachery, falsehood and cruelty
than exists in West India slavery; I was about
saying even in the brains of an abolitionist. Most
tenderly nurtured, under the care of an affectionate
old aunt, who was always fixing my clothes to keep
me warm, coddling up something nice to pamper me
with, watching all my outgoings and incomings, and
seeing that everything around me conduced to my
convenience and comfort, the contrast was indeed
great when I appeared at the Belle Air academy, one
of the smallest boys there, and subjected to the
taunts and buffetings of every larger boy than myself
in the institution. My father little knew what agony
it cost me to be made a man of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am not certain that the good produced by such
academies is equal to their evils. I remember well
for two or three nights after Prettyman laughed at
me, that I crept into bed to say my prayers, and, at
last, under his ridicule—for he practised his gift on
me every night—I not only neglected to say them,
but began to feel angry towards my aunt that she
had ever learned them to me, as they brought so
much contempt upon me. Yet, such is the power of
conscience, at that tender age, that, when I awoke in
the morning of the first night that I had not prayed,
I felt myself guilty and unworthy, and went into the
garden and wept aloud, tears of sincere contrition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Too often, in public schools, the first thing a youth
learns from his elders, is to laugh at parental authority,
and to exhibit to the ridicule of his fellows
the letter of advice which his parent or guardian
feels it his duty to write to him, taking care, with a
jest upon them, to pocket the money they send, with
an air of incipient profligacy which, any one may see,
will soon not only be rank but prurient—such a
moral contagion should be avoided, and, I therefore
am inclined to think that the Catholic mode of tuition,
where some one of the teachers is with the
scholars, not only by day but by night, is preferable.
And, in fact, any one who has witnessed the respectful
familiarity they teach their pupils to feel and act
towards them, and the kindness with which they return
it, cannot but be impressed with the truth of my
remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were nearly one hundred pupils at Belle Air,
at the period of which I write, and the only assistant
Mr. Sears had, was a gaunt fellow named Dogberry.
Like his illustrious namesake in Shakspeare, from
whom I believe he was a legitimate descendant, he
might truly have been “<span class='it'>written down an ass</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys invented all sorts of annoyances to torture
Dogberry withal. A favorite one was, when
Mr. Sears was in the city, which was at periods not
unfrequent, for them to assemble in the school before
Dogberry came, and setting one by the door to give
notice when the usher was within a few feet of it, to
begin as soon as he appeared in sight, to shout, as
with one voice—first <span class='it'>Dog</span>, and then, after a pause,
by way of a chorus, <span class='it'>berry</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as notice was given by the watcher, he
leaped to his seat, and every tongue was silent, and
every eye upon the book before it. The rage of Dogberry
knew no bounds on these occasions. He did
not like to tell the principal, for the circumstance
would have proved not only his want of authority
over the boys, but the contempt in which they held
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A trick which Prettyman played him, nearly
caused his death, and, luckily for the delinquent, he
was never discovered. Dogberry was very penurious,
and he saved two-thirds of his salary; as it was not
large, he had, of course, to live humbly. He dined at
Halls and took breakfast and supper in his lodgings,
if he ever took them, and the quality of the dinner of
which he made himself the receptacle, caused it to
be doubted. His lodgings were the <span class='it'>dormant</span> story
of a log cabin, to which he had entrance by a rough
flight of stairs without the house and against its side.
Under the stairs there was a large mud-hole, and
Prettyman contrived one gusty night to pull them
down, with the intention of calling the usher in the
tone of Mr. Sears, for he was a good mimic, and
causing him to fall in the mud. Unluckily, the usher
heard the racket without, and not dreaming it was
the fall of the stairs, he leaped from his bed, and hurried
out to see what it was. He fell on them, and
though no bones were broken, he was laid up for
several weeks. The wind always had the credit of
the affair, and Prettyman won great applause for his
speedy assistance and sympathy with Dogberry,
whom he visited constantly during his confinement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night of the adjournment of court, the lawyers,
and even the judges, had what they called a
regular frolic. Mr. Sears was in Baltimore, and the
scholars were easily induced to join in it—in fact
they wanted no inducement. About twelve o’clock
at night we were aroused from our beds by a most
awful yelling for the ex-sheriff. “Hall, Hall,” was
the cry—soon the door was opened, and the trampling
of feet was heard—in a minute the frolickers
ascended the stairs, and one of the judges, with a
blanket wrapped round him, like an Indian, with
his face painted, and a red handkerchief tied round
his head, and with red slippers on, entered our room,
with a candle in one hand and a bottle in the other;
and, after making us drink all round, bade us get up.
We were nothing loath. On descending into the
dining-room, lo! there were the whole bar, dressed
off in the most fantastic style, and some of them
scarcely dressed at all. They were mad with fun
and wine. The ex-sheriff brought forth his liquors,
and was placed on his own table as a culprit, and
tried and found guilty of not having been, as in duty
bound, one of the originators of the frolic. He was,
therefore, fined glasses round for the company, and
ordered by the judges to pay it at Richardson’s bar.
To Richardson’s the order was given to repair. Accordingly,
without they formed a line, Indian file.
Two large black women carried a light in each hand
beside the first judge, and two smaller black women
carried a light in the right hand beside the next one.
The lawyers followed, each with a light in his hand,
and the procession closed with the scholars, who
each also bore a light. I, being smallest, brought up
the rear. There was neither man nor boy who was
not more or less inebriated, and the wildest pranks
were played.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we reached Dogberry’s domicile, one of the
boys proposed to have him out with us. The question
was put by one of the judges and carried by acclamation
unanimously. It was further resolved,
that a deputation of three, each bearing a bottle of
different liquor, should be appointed to wait on him,
with the request that he would visit the Pawnee
tribe, from the far west, drink some fire-water with
them, and smoke the pipe of peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prettyman, whose recklessness knew no bounds,
and who, as I suppose, wished to involve me in difficulty,
moved that the smallest and tallest person in
the council be of that deputation. There happened
to be a quantity of logs, which had been gathered
there for the purpose of building a log house. Mr.
Patterson (I use here a fictitious name) was at this
time the great lawyer of Maryland. He was dressed
in a splendid Indian costume, which a western client
had given him, and he had painted himself with
care and taste. He was a fine looking man, and
stretching out his hand, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers, be seated; but not on the prostrate
forms of the forest, which the ruthless white man has
felled to make unto himself a habitation. Like the
big warrior Tecumseh, in council with the great
white chief Harrison, we will sit upon the lap of our
mother the earth—upon her breast we will sleep—the
Pawnee has no roof but the blue sky, where
dwelleth the Great Spirit—and he looks up to the
shining stars, and they look down upon him—and
they count the leaves of the forest and know the
might of the Pawnees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one, by this time, had taken a seat upon the
ground, and all were silent. As the lights flashed
o’er the group, they formed as grotesque a scene as I
have ever witnessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers,” he continued, “those eyes of the
Great Spirit,” pointing upwards to the stars, “behold
the rushing river, and they say to our fathers,
who are in the happy hunting grounds of the blest,
that, like it, is the might of the Pawnee when he
rushes to battle. The white men are dogs—their
carcasses drift in the tide—they are cast out on the
shore, and the prairie-wolf fattens on them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers—the eyes of the Great Spirit behold
the prairies and the forest, where the breath of
the wintry wind bears the red fire through them—where
the prairie-wolf flies, and the fire flies faster.
Brothers, the white man is the prairie-wolf, and the
Pawnee is the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers—when the forked fire from the right
arm of the Great Spirit smites the mountain’s brow,
the eagle soars upwards to his home in the clouds,
but the snake crawls over the bare rock in the blast,
and hides in the clefts and in the hollows and holes.
Behold! the forked fire strikes the rock and scatters
it as the big warrior would throw pebbles from his
hand, and the soaring eagle darts from the clouds
and the death-rattle of the snake is heard, and he
hisses no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers—the Pawnee is the eagle, the bird of
the Great Spirit, and the white man is the crawling
snake that the Great Spirit hates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers—the shining eyes of the Great Spirit
sees all these things, and tells them to our fathers,
who are in the happy hunting ground of the blest,
and they say that some day, wrapped in the clouds,
they will come and see us, for our land is like
theirs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was said with so much eloquence, by the distinguished
lawyer, that there was the silence of
nearly a minute when he concluded. In the company
was a lawyer named Short, who, strange to say,
was just six feet three inches and a half high, and he
had a client—which is stranger still—named Long,
who was but five feet high.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who has precedence, Judge Willard?” called out
somebody in the crowd, breaking in upon the business
of the occasion, as upon such occasions business
always will be broken in upon—“who has precedence,
Long or Short?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Long,” exclaimed the judge,
“of course. It is a settled rule in law, that you
must take as much land as is called for in the deed—therefore
Long takes precedence of Short. May be,
Short has a remedy in equity; but this court has nothing
to do with that—so you have the <span class='it'>long</span> and
the <span class='it'>short</span> of the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Judge,” cried out the ex-sheriff, “we must go to
Richardson’s—you know it is my treat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Pawnee—the eagle of his race,”—exclaimed
Patterson, “the prophet of his tribe; he who is
more than warrior—whose tongue is clothed with the
Great Spirit’s thunder—who can speak with the eloquence
of the spring air when it whispers amidst
the leaves and makes the flowers open and give forth
their sweets—he, the Charming Serpent, that hath a
tongue forked with persuasion—he, even he, will
go in to the white man, and invite him to come forth
and taste the fire-water, and smoke the pipe of peace
with the Pawnee. Then, if he comes not forth when
the charming serpent takes him by the hand, and
bids him, the Pawnees shall smoke him out like a
fox, and his blazing habitation shall make night
pale, and there shall be no resting place for his foot,
and children and squaws shall whip him into the
forest, and set the dogs upon his trail, and he shall
be hunted from hill to hill, from river to river, from
prairie to prairie, from forest to forest, till, like the
frightened deer, he rushes, panting, into the great
lakes, and the waters rise over him, and cover him
from the Pawnees’ scorn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was received with acclamation. Mr. Patterson
played the Indian so well, that he drew me one
of the closest to him, in the charmed circle that surrounded
him. His eye flashed, his lips quivered with
fiery ardor, though at the mimic scene. I was so
lost in admiration of him, that I placed myself beside
him without knowing it. He saw the effect he
had produced upon me, and was evidently gratified.
Taking me by the hand, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Warriors and braves, give unto me the brand,
that the Charming Serpent may light the steps of the
boy to the hiding-place of the pale-face. He shall
listen to the eloquence of the Charming Serpent when
he takes the white man by the hand—he shall learn
how to move alike the heart of the pale-face and the
red man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers—the Charming Serpent to-night,” said
he, handing me the candle, and placing himself in an
oratorial attitude, while every man lifted up his candle
so that it shone full upon him,—“Brothers, the
Charming Serpent to-night could speak unto the four
winds that are now howling in the desolate Pawnee
paths of the wilderness, and make them sink into a
low moan, and sigh themselves to silence, were he
to tell them of the many of his tribe who are now
lying mangled, unburied, and cold, beneath the
shadow of the rocky mountains—victims of the
white man’s vengeance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers: O! that the Great Spirit would give the
Charming Serpent his voice of thunder—then would
he stand upon the highest peak of the Alleghanies,
with the forked lightning in his red right hand, and
tell a listening and heart-struck world the wrong of
his race. And, when all of every tribe of every people
had come crouching in the valleys, and had filled
up the gorges of the hills, then would the Charming
Serpent hurl vengeance on the oppressor. But come,”
said he, taking the candle in one hand, and myself
by the other, “the Pawnee talks like a squaw. The
Charming Serpent will speak with the pale-face, and
lead him forth from his wigwam to the great council
fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, the Charming Serpent took me by
the hand, and led me up the stairs. His steps were
steady, and it was evident that his libations had excited
his brain, and, instead of weakening him, given
him strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s your name?” said he to me kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“William Russel, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know me, my little fellow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, you’re Mr. Patterson, the great lawyer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, ah! they call me a great lawyer, do they!
What else do they say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you’re the greatest orator in the country,”
I replied—for what I had drank made me bold too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They do—I know they do, my little fellow—I
believe, in fact, that I could have stood up in the
Areopagus of old, in favor of human rights, and faced
the best of them. Yes, sir, I too could have ‘fulmined
over Greece.’ But we are not Grecians now—we
are Pawnees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop, stop, Mr. Pawnee,” called out some one
from the crowd, “Short was to go, he is the tallest
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The tallest man,” re-echoed Mr. Patterson, speaking
in his natural tone. “The judge, sir, has already
decided that by just legal construction, Short is
short, no matter how long he is; and, if he claims to
be long, sir, I can just inform him that Lord Bacon
says ‘that tall men are like tall houses, the upper
story is the worst furnished.’ ” Here, every eye was
turned on Short, and there was a shout of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If,” continued Mr. Patterson—and it was evident
his potations were doing their work—“if it be true—I’ll
just say this to you, sirs. Doctor Watts was a
very small man; and, I repeat it for the benefit of all
small men—</p>

he began to forget his personation, “why do we value

<p class='pindent'>“The usher—Dogberry—let’s have Dogberry,”
called out several of the students.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” exclaimed Mr. Patterson; “Dogberry,
ha! He’s Goldsmith’s village teacher, that caused
the wonder</p>

<p class='noindent'>Dogberry—Dogberry—but that sounds Shakspearian.
‘Reading and writing comes by Nature.’ That’s certainly
not his sentiments; were they, he should
throw away the usher’s rod and betake himself to
something else; for if these things come by nature,
then is Dogberry’s occupation gone. Yes, he had
better betake himself to the constableship. Come,
my little friend—come, son of the Pawnee, and we
will arouse the pale face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stepping by the side of Mr. Patterson, we ascended
to the little platform in front of Dogberry’s door,
at which we rapped three times distinctly. “Who’s
there?” cried out a voice from within. Dogberry
must of course have been awake for at least half an
hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pale face,” said the Pawnee chief, “thou hast
not followed the example of the great chief of the
pale faces; the string of thy latch is pulled in. Upon
my word, this is certainly the attic story,” he continued
in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not very well to-night, gentlemen, unless
your business is pressing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pressing! Pale face, the Pawnees have lit their
council fire, and invite thee to drink with them the
fire-water and smoke the pipe of peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, gentlemen, I never drink,” responded
Dogberry, in an impatient tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never drink! Pale face, thou liest! Who made
the fire-water, and gave it to my people, but thee and
thine? Lo! before it, though they once covered the
land, they have melted away like snow beneath the
sun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I belong to the temperance society,” cried out
Dogberry from within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dogberry,” exclaimed Patterson—whose patience,
like that of the crowd below, who were calling
for the usher as if they were at a town meeting, and
expected him to speak, was becoming exhausted—“Dogberry,
compel me not, as your great namesake
would say, to commit either ‘perjury’ or ‘burglary,’
and break your door open. You remember in Marmion,
Dogberry, that the chief, speaking of the insult
which had been put upon him, said,</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line0'>Though in the very court of Heaven.’</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Now I will not say that I would make you drink
wherever the old chief would ‘right his wrongs,’ but
this I will say, that wherever I, Burbage Patterson,
get drunk, I think you can come forth and take a
stirrup cup with him; he leaves for the Supreme
Court to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Patterson,” said Dogberry, coming towards
the door, “your character can stand it—it can stand
anything—mine can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s truth in that,” said Mr. Patterson aside
to me. “Gentlemen, let us leave the pedagogue to
his reflections; and now it occurs to me that we had
better not uncage him, for, boys, he would be a witness
against you; more, witness, judge, jury and executioner—by
the by, clear against law. Were I
in your place, I would appeal, and for every stripe
he gives you, should the judgment be reversed, do
you give him two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here a sprightly fellow, one of the scholars, named
Morris, from Long Green, ran up the steps and said
to Mr. Patterson,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do, sir, have him out, for if we get him into the
frolic too, we are as safe, sir, as if we were all in our
beds. He has seen us all through some infernal
crack or other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” exclaimed Mr. Patterson, in a low tone to
Morris, “he has been playing Cowper, has he—looking
from the loopholes of retreat, seeing the
Babel and not feeling the stir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes sir, but he’ll make a stir about it to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He shall come forth, then,” said Mr. Patterson;
“Dogberry, open the door; they speak of removing
Sears, and why don’t you come forth and greet your
friends? We have an idea of getting the appointment
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This flattery took instant effect, for we heard Dogberry
bustling to the door, and in a moment it was
opened about half way, and the usher put his head
out, and said, but with the evident wish that his invitation
would be refused, “Will you come in sir?
Why, William Russell!” to me, in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pale face, this is a youthful brave, whom I
want the pale face to teach the arts of his race. Behold!
I am the Charming Serpent. Come forth and
taste of the fire-water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Mr. Patterson spoke, he took Dogberry by the
hand, and pulled him on to the platform. The usher
was greeted with loud acclamations and laughter by
the crowd. He, however, did not relish it, and was
frightened out of his wits. He really looked the personification
of a caricature. His head was covered
with an old flannel nightcap, notwithstanding it was
warm weather, and his trousers were held up by his
hips, while his suspenders dangled about his knees.
On his right leg he had an old boot, and on his left
foot an old shoe, and was without coat or vest. As
Mr. Patterson held up the light, so that the crowd
below could see him, there was such a yelling as
had not been heard on the spot since those whose
characters the crowd were assuming had left it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dogberry hastily withdrew into his room, but followed
by Mr. Patterson and myself, each bearing a
light. When we entered, the crowd rushed up the
steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake, sir, for the sake of my character
and situation, don’t let them come in here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They shall not, if you will promise to drink with
me. Pale face, speak, will you drink with the
Pawnee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes sir,” said Dogberry, faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charming Serpent here went to the door, and
said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers, the Charming Serpent would hold a
private talk with the chief of the pale faces. Ere long,
he will be with you. Let the Big Bull (one of the
lawyers was named Bull, and he was very humorous,)
pass round the fire-water and the calumet, and by
that time the Charming Serpent will come forth.
Brothers, give unto the Charming Serpent some of
the fire-water, that he may work his spells.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dozen handed up bottles of different wines and
liquors. The Charming Serpent gave Dogberry the
candles to hold, took a bottle of Champaigne, and
handed me another. Then shutting the door, he
said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the fire-water that hath no evil in it. It
courses through the veins like a silvery lake through
the prairie, where the wild grass waves green and
placid, and it makes the heart merry like the merriment
of birds in the spring-time, and not with the
fierce fires of the dark lake, like the strong fire-water,
that glows red as the living coal. Brothers, we will
drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dogberry’s apartment was indeed an humble one.
Only in the centre of it could you stand upright.
Over our heads were the rafters and bare shingles,
formed exactly in the shape of the capital letter A
inverted, or rather V. Opposite the door was a little
window of four panes of glass, and under it, or rather
beside it, in the corner, was a little bedstead, with a
straw mattrass upon it. A small table, with a tumbler
and broken pitcher, and candle in a tin candlestick
on it, stood opposite the bed. A board, nailed
across from rafter to rafter, held a few books, and
beside it, on nails, were several articles of clothing.
There were besides in the apartment two chairs, and
a wooden chest in the corner, by the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, drink, my old boy,” exclaimed Patterson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. Patterson, your character can
stand it, I tell you, but mine can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend of my soul, this goblet sip,” reiterated
Patterson, offering Dogberry the glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. Patterson, I would not choose
any,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t but choose, Dogberry; there is no alternative.
Do you remember what the poet beautifully
says of the Roman daughter, who sustained her
imprisoned father from her own breast?—</p>

<p class='noindent'>Do you remember it? I bid you drink, then, and I
say to you, Hebe nor Ganymede ever offered to the
immortals purer wine than that. Drink! here’s to
you, Dogberry, and to your speedy promotion,” and
Mr. Patterson swallowed every drop in the glass, and
re-filling it, handed it to the usher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without much hesitation, he drank it. He now
filled me up a glass nearly full, and I followed the
example of my preceptor, he the while looking at me
with astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you like the letter, Mr. Dogberry?”
asked Mr. Patterson of the pedagogue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What letter, sir? Mr. Patterson, I must say this
is a strange proceeding. I don’t know, sir, to what
you allude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know to what I allude! Why, the letter
wishing to know if you would take the academy at
the same price at which Sears now holds it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, I have received no such letter. I certainly,
sir, would, if it was thought that I was—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was competent. Merit is always modest; you’re
the most competent of the two, sir—take some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So saying, Mr. Patterson filled up the tumbler, and
Dogberry swallowed the compliment and the wine
together, and fixed his eye on the rafters with an exulting
look. While he was so gazing, the lawyer
filled his glass, and observed, “Come, drink, and let
me open this other bottle; I want a glass myself.”
Down went the wine, and, with a smack of his lips,
Dogberry handed the glass to Mr. Patterson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Capital, ain’t it, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Capital,” re-echoed Dogberry. The wine and his
supposed honors had aroused the brain of the pedagogue
in a manner which seemed to awake him to a
new existence. While Mr. Patterson was striking
the top from the other bottle, Dogberry handed me
the candle which he held—the other he had put in
his candlestick, taking out his own when he first
drank—and lifting the tumbler, he stood ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he quaffed a bumper. The effect of his potations
on him was electrical. He had a long face,
with a snipe-like nose, which was subjected to a nervous
twitching whenever its owner was excited. It
now danced about, seemingly, all over his face, while
his naturally cadaverous countenance, under the excitement,
turned to a glowing red, and his small ferret
eyes looked both dignified and dancing, merry and
important. “So,” exclaimed he, “I am to be principal
of the academy; ha, ha, ha! oh, Lord! William
Russell, I would reprove you on the spot, but
that you are in such distinguished company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether Dogberry meant only Mr. Patterson, or
included himself, I do not know, but as he spoke he
arose, and paced his humble apartment with a proud
tread, forgetting what a figure he cut, with his suspenders
dangling about his knees and his nightcap on,
and forgetting also that his attic was not high enough
to admit his head to be carried at its present altitude.
The consequence was that he struck it against one of
the rafters, with a violence that threatened injury to
the rafter, if not to the head. He stooped down to
rub the affected part, when Mr. Patterson said to him,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Pro-di-gi-ous,’ as Dominie Sampson, one of you,
said, ain’t it? Come, we’ll finish this bottle, and
then go forth. The scholars are all rejoiced at your
promotion, and are all assembled without to do you
honor. They have made complete saturnalia of it.
They marvel now why you treat them with so much
reserve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gad, I’ll do it,” exclaimed Dogberry, taking the
tumbler and swallowing the contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just put your blanket around you,” said Patterson
to him. “Let your nightcap remain; it becomes
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it don’t indeed, though, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does, ’pon honor. That’s it. Now, pale face,
come forth; the eloquence of the Charming Serpent
has prevailed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So speaking, Mr. Patterson opened the door, and
we stepped on to the platform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene without was grotesque in the extreme.
In front of us, I suppose to the number of an hundred
persons, were the frolickers, composed of lawyers,
students and town’s-people, all seated in a circle,
while Mr. Patterson’s client from the West, dressed
in costume, was giving the Pawnee war dance. This
client was a rough uneducated man, but full of originality
and whim. Mr. Patterson had gained a suit
for him, in which the title to an estate in the neighborhood
was involved, worth upwards of sixty thousand
dollars. The whole bar had believed that the
suit could not be sustained by Patterson, but his luminous
mind had detected the clue through the labyrinths
of litigation, where they saw nothing but confusion
and defeat. His client was overjoyed at the
result, as every one had croaked defeat to him. He
gave Mr. Patterson fifteen thousand dollars, five
more than he had promised, and besides had made
him a present of the splendid Indian dress in which,
as a bit of fun, before the frolic commenced, he had
decked himself, under the supervision of his client,
who acted as his costumer, and afterwards dressed
himself in the same way. The client had a great
many Indian dresses with him, which he had collected
with great care, and on this occasion he threw
open his trunks, and supplied nearly the whole bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name of Mr. Patterson’s client was Blackwood,
and the admiration which he excited seemed
to give him no little pleasure. Most of the lawyers
in the circle had something Indian on them, while
the boys, who could not appear in costume, and were
determined to appear wild, had turned their jackets
wrong side out, and swapped with each other, the
big ones with the little, so that one wore his neighbor’s
jacket, the waist of which came up under his
arms, and exhibited the back of his vest, while the
other wore a coat the hip buttons of which were at
his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the outskirts of this motley assembly could be
seen, here and there, a negro, who might be said at
once to contribute to the darkness that surrounded
the scene and to reflect light upon it, for their black
skins were as ebon as night, while their broad grins
certainly had something luminous about them, as
their white teeth shone forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We stood about a minute admiring the dance, when
it was concluded, and some one espied us, and pointed
us out to the rest. We, or rather I should say
Dogberry, was greeted with three times three. I
have never seen, for the size of the assembly, such an
uproarious outbreak of bacchanalian merriment.
After the cheers were given, many of the boys threw
themselves on the grass and rolled over and over,
shouting as they rolled. Others jerked their fellows’
hats off, and hurled them in air. Prettyman stood
with his arms folded, as if he did not know what to
make of it, and then deliberately spreading his blanket
on the ground, as deliberately took a seat in the
centre of it, as if determined to maintain the full possession
of his faculties, and, like an amateur at a
play, enjoy the scene. Morris held his sides, stooped
down his head, and glanced sideways cunningly at
Dogberry, throwing his head back every now and
then with a sudden jerk, while loud explosive bursts
of laughter, from his very heart, echoed through the
village above every other sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A speech from Dogberry!” exclaimed Prettyman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, a speech!” shouted Morris, “a speech!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, gentlemen, not now,” exclaimed Richardson,
the proprietor of one of the hotels; “I sent down to
my house an hour ago, and have had a collation
served. Mr. Patterson, and gentlemen and students
all, I invite you to partake with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence!” called out Mr. Patterson. All were
silent. “Students of the Belle Air Academy and
citizens generally, I have the honor to announce to
you that my friend, Mr. Dogberry, is about to supersede
Mr. Sears. We must form a procession and
place him in our midst, the post of honor, and then
to mine host’s.” So speaking, Mr. Patterson descended,
followed by Dogberry and myself. The students
gave their candles to the negroes to hold, joined their
hands, and danced round Dogberry with the wildest
glee, while he received it all in drunken dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I have seen since, in Chapman’s floating
theatre, or in a barn or shed, some lubberly, drunken
son of the sock and buskin enact Macbeth, with the
witches about him, I have recalled this scene, and
thought that the boys looked like the witches and
Dogberry like the Thane, when the witches greet
him:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>‘All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!’</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The procession was at length formed. Surrounded
by the boys, who rent the air with shouts, with his
nightcap on his head and his blanket around him,
with one boot and one shoe, Dogberry, following immediately
after the judges, proceeded with them to
Richardson’s hotel. Whenever there was the silence
of a minute or two, some boy or other would ask Dogberry
not to remember on the morrow that he saw
them out that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, boys, no, certainly not; this thing, I understand,
is done in honor of me. I shan’t take Sears in
even as an assistant. Boys, he has not used me
well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We arrived at Richardson’s as well as we could,
having business on both sides of the street. His
dining-room was a very large one, and he had a very
fine collation set out, with plenty of wines and other
liquors. Judge Willard took the head of the table
and Judge Nolan the foot. Dogberry was to the right
of Judge Willard and Mr. Patterson to the left. He
made me sit beside him. The eating was soon despatched,
and it silenced us all a little, while it laid
the groundwork for standing another supply of wine,
which was soon sparkling in our glasses, and we
were now all more excited than ever. It was amusing
to see the merry faces of my schoolmates twinkling
about among the crowd, trying to catch and comprehend
whatever was said by the lawyers, particularly
those that were distinguished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Songs were sung, sentiments given, and Indian
talks held by the quantity. Dogberry looked the
while first at the boys and then at the lawyers and
then at himself, not knowing whether or not the
scene before him was a reality or a dream. The
great respect which the boys showed him, and Patterson’s
making an occasional remark to him, seemed
at last not only fully to impress him with the reality,
but also with a full, if not a sober conviction of his
own importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A song!—a song!” was shouted by a dozen of
the larger students; “a song from Morris. Give us
‘Down with the pedagogue Sears.’ Hurrah for old
Dogberry—Dogberry forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” cried out others, “a speech from Mr. Patterson—no,
from the Pawnee. You’re fineable for
not speaking in character.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Prettyman took Mr. Patterson courteously
by the hand, and said something to him in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah ha!” exclaimed Mr. Patterson, “so shall it
be; I like Morris. Come, my good fellow, sing us
the song you wrote; come, Dogberry’s star is now in
the ascendant. ‘Down with the pedagogue Sears’—let’s
have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing loth, Morris was placed on the table,
while the students gathered round him, ready to join
the chorus. Taking a preparatory glass of wine,
while Mr. Patterson rapped on the table by way of
commanding silence, Morris placed himself in an attitude
and sang the following song, which he had
written on some rebellious occasion or other:</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the whole room was in uproarious chorusing,
who should enter but Sears himself. He looked
round with stern dignity and surprise, at first uncertain
on whom to fix his indignation, when his eye lit
on Dogberry, who, the most elated and inebriated of
all, was flourishing his nightcap over his head, and
shouting, at the top of his voice,</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Down with the pedagogue Sears.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>As soon as Sears caught a view of Dogberry, he advanced
towards him, as if determined to inflict personal
chastisement on the usher. At first Dogberry
prepared again to vociferate the chorus, but when he
caught the eye of Sears, his voice failed him, and he
moved hastily towards Mr. Patterson, who slapped
him on the shoulder, and cried out,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dogberry, be true to yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am true to myself. Yes, my old boy, old Sears,
you’re no longer head devil at Belle Air Academy.
You’re no devil at all, or if you are, old boy, you’re
a poor devil, and be d—d to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a drunken outcast, sir,” exclaimed Sears.
“Never let me see your face again; I dismiss you
from my service,” and so speaking, he took a note
book from his pocket, and began hastily to take
down the names of the students. The Big Bull saw
this, and caught it from his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, sir,” exclaimed Sears, enraged, “my vocation,
and not any respect I bear you, prevents my infliction
of personal chastisement upon you. Boys,
young gentlemen, leave instantly for your respective
boarding houses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this, Patterson was clapping Dogberry on
the shoulder, evidently endeavoring to inspire him
with courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him yourself,” I overheard Dogberry say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” replied Patterson, “it is your place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, I’ll tell you at once, Sears, you’re no
longer principal of this academy; you’re dished.
Mr. Patterson, sir, will tell you so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Patterson!” exclaimed Sears, now for the
first time recognizing, in the semblance of the Indian
chief, the distinguished lawyer and statesman. “Sir,
I am more than astonished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” rejoined Patterson, drawing himself up with
dignity, “I am a Pawnee brave; more, a red man
eloquent or a pale face eloquent, as it pleases me;
but, sir, under all circumstances, I respect your craft
and calling. What more dignified than such? A
poor, unfriended boy, I was taken by the hand by
an humble teacher of a country school, and here I
stand, let me say sir, high in the councils of a great
people. Peace to old Playfair’s ashes. The old
philosopher, like Porson, loved his cups, and, like
Parr, loved his pipe; but, sir, he was a ripe scholar
and a noble spirit, and I have so said, sir, in the
humble monument which I am proud, sir, I was enabled,
through the education he gave me, to build over
him.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Yes, as some one says, he was ‘my friend before I
had flatterers.’ How proud he was of me! I remember
well catching his eye in making my first
speech, and the approving nod he gave me had more
gratification to me than the approbation of bench,
bar and audience. Glorious old Playfair! Mr.
Sears, you were his pupil too. Many a time have I
heard him speak of you; he said, of all his pupils,
you were the one to wear his mantle. And, sir, that
was the highest compliment he could pay you—the
highest, Mr. Speaker, for he esteemed himself of the
class of the philosophers, the teachers of youth. Sir,
Mr. Sears, I propose to you that in testimony of our
life-long respect for him, we drink to his memory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was said so eloquently, and withal so naturally,
that Sears, forgetful of his whereabouts, took
the glass which Mr. Patterson offered him, and drank
its contents reverently to the memory of his old
teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” resumed Patterson, “how glorious is your
vocation! But tell me, do you subscribe to the sentiment
of Don Juan?—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The appropriate quotation caused a thrill to run
through the assembled students, while they cast
ominous looks at each other. For the life of him,
Sears could not resist a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this Mr. Patterson glanced at us with a quiet
meaning, and turning to Mr. Sears, he continued:
“The elder Adams taught school—he whose eloquence
Jefferson has so loudly lauded—the man who
was for liberty or death, and so expressed himself in
that beautiful letter to his wife. Do you not remember
that passage, sir, where he speaks of the Fourth
being greeted thereafter with bonfires and illuminations?
His son, Johnny Q., taught school. My
dark-eyed friend Webster, who is now figuring so
gloriously in the halls of Congress and in the Supreme
Court, taught school. Judge Rowan, of Kentucky,
a master spirit too, taught school. Who was
that</p>

<p class='noindent'>Who was he? Milton, the glorious, the sublime—who,

Sears, let us drink the health of the blind old man
eloquent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, thank you, Mr. Patterson, but before
my scholars, under the circumstances, it would be
setting a bad example, when existing circumstances
prove they need a good one. Sir, it was thought that
I should not return from Baltimore until to-morrow,
and this advantage has been taken of my absence.
But, Mr. Patterson, when such distinguished gentlemen
as yourself set the example, I know not what to
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive them, sir, forgive them,” said Patterson,
in his blandest tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them repair to their homes, then, instantly.
Mr. Patterson, your eloquent conversation had made
me forget myself; I don’t wonder they should have
forgotten themselves. Let them depart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, boys,” exclaimed Mr. Patterson, “I have
a greater opinion of my oratorical powers than ever.
Be ye all dismissed until I again appear as a Pawnee
brave, which I fear will be a long time, for ’tis
not every day that such men as my western client
are picked up. But, Mr. Sears, what do you say
about Dogberry? He must be where he was; to-morrow
must but type yesterday. Dogberry, how is
Verges?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know him,” said Dogberry, doggedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sir, he is the associate of your namesake
in Shakspeare’s immortal page. Let this play to-night,
Mr. Sears, be like that in which Dogberry’s
namesake appeared—let it be ‘Much Ado About
Nothing.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sears smiled, and nodded his head approvingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then be the court adjourned,” exclaimed Mr.
Patterson. “Dogberry, you and my friend Sears are
still together, and you must remember in the premises
what your namesake said to Verges, ‘An’ two
men ride of a horse, one man must ride behind.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giving three cheers for Mr. Patterson, we boys departed,
and the next day found us betimes in the
academy, where mum was the word between all
parties.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CUTTING OUT.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>We had now been several months at sea, and, although
our stores had been more than once replenished
from the prizes we had taken, our provisions
began to grow scarce. The skipper accordingly announced
his intention of going into port. We bore
up, therefore, for Charleston, that being the most
convenient harbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My emotions on approaching the place where
Beatrice resided, I shall not attempt to describe. A
full year had passed since we had parted, and in all
that time I had heard of her but once. Might she
not now be married to another? The proverbial
fickleness of her sex; the known opposition of her
family to my suit; her uncertainty whether I still
continued to care for her, or whether even I was yet
alive; and a thousand other reasons why she might
be unfaithful to me, rose up before me to torture me
with doubts. But most of all, I reflected on our different
situations in society. She was rich, courted,
allied to rank—I was poor, unknown, and a rebel
officer. Many a night as I lay in my solitary hammock,
or trod my silent watch on deck, the fear that
I might find Beatrice the wife of another, filled my
soul with agony. And yet could I doubt her faith?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length we entered Charleston harbor, and with
a gentle breeze floated up towards the town. It was
a moonless night, but the sky above was spangled
with a thousand stars, and the low outline of the
city before us glittered with myriads of lamps. The
wind just ruffled the glassy surface of the bay, fanning
us, as it swept by, with a delicious coolness.
Here and there, on either shore, a light from a solitary
house flickered through the darkness, while occasionally
a sheet of summer lightning would play
along the western firmament, where a low belt of
clouds skirted the horizon, and hung like a veil
above the city. Everything reminded me of the
night when I had sailed up this same harbor with
Beatrice. What had I not witnessed since then!
The shipwreck, the battle, the hurricane, fire and
sword, danger in every shape, almost death itself—I
had endured them all. During that period where
had been Beatrice? A few hours would determine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a beating heart, the next morning I sought
the residence of Beatrice’s uncle. How my brain
swam and my knees tottered when I came in sight of
the mansion which contained the form of her whom
I loved! I had understood that the family, except
one or two of the ladies of it, was out of town, and
I burned with impatience to ascertain whether Beatrice
was among the absentees. Yet my heart failed
me when I came in sight of the residence of her
uncle. I recollected the terms on which I had parted
with Mr. Rochester, and I scarcely thought myself
allowable in intruding on his hospitality in any
shape. But, then, how else could I obtain an interview
with Beatrice? Again and again I approached
the door, and again and again I changed my mind
and retired; but at length remembering that my
conduct was attracting attention, and unable longer
to endure my suspense, I advanced boldly to the portal,
and knocked at the hall door. It was answered
by a strange porter. With a fluttering heart I inquired
for Miss Derwent. I felt relieved from a load
of fear when informed that she was in town, and
hastily thrusting my card into the man’s hand, I followed
him eagerly into the drawing-room. He disappeared,
and I was alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who can forget his emotions, when, after a long
separation from the object of his love, he finds himself
under the same roof with his mistress, awaiting
her appearance? How he pictures to himself the
joy with which the announcement of his arrival, especially
if unexpected, will be received! He fancies
every look that will be exchanged and every
word that will be said at the moment of meeting.
As the moments elapse, he imagines, however short
the time may be, that the appearance of his mistress
is unavoidably delayed, and a hundred fears arise,
vague, unfounded, and but half believed, that perhaps
her affection has grown lukewarm. Each successive
instant of suspense increases his doubts until they
amount almost to agony; and as a light footfall—oh!
how well remembered!—breaks upon his ear,
he almost dreads to meet her whom but an hour before
he would have given worlds to behold. So was
it now with myself. As minute after minute elapsed,
and still Beatrice did not appear, my fears amounted
almost to madness; and when at length I heard her
light tread approaching, my heart began to beat so
violently that I thought I should have fainted.
Anxious to resolve my doubts, by observing her demeanor
before I should be seen myself, I sprang into
the recess of a window. As I did so, the door opened
and Beatrice entered hurriedly, looking, if possible,
more beautiful than ever. Her cheek was
flushed, her step was quick and eager, and her eyes
shone with a joy that could not be affected. She advanced
several steps into the room, when, perceiving
no one, she gazed inquiringly around, with a look, I
thought, of disappointment. I moved from the recess.
She turned quickly around at the noise, blushed
over brow, neck and bosom, and, with a faint cry
of joy, sprang forward, and was locked the next instant
in my arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beatrice—my own, my beautiful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry—<span class='it'>dear</span> Harry!” were our mutual exclamations,
and then, locked in each other’s embrace,
for a moment we forgot in our rapture to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length we awoke from this trance of delight,
and found leisure for rational conversation. Sitting
side by side on the sofa, with our hands locked together,
and our eyes looking as it were into each
other’s souls, we recounted our mutual histories since
our separation. With mine the reader is already
acquainted. That of Beatrice was naturally less
chequered, but yet it was not without interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said that an alliance had been projected between
Beatrice and her cousin, and that Mr. Rochester
had placed his whole soul on the consummation
of this project. The consciousness of my interest in
the heart of Beatrice had induced their conduct towards
myself, under the hope that if once separated
from her, I would be eventually forgotten by Miss
Derwent. Time, however, proved how false had
been this hope. Instead of prospering in his suit
from my absence, every day only seemed to make
the success of her cousin more problematical. In
vain her uncle persuaded; in vain he expostulated;
in vain he lavished all his scorn on me as a beggar
and a rebel—Beatrice continued unmoved; now defending
me from every imputation, and now with
tears giving up the contest, although unconvinced.
The letter she received from me, by acquainting her
with my projected cruise, prepared her for the long
silence on my part which had ensued; and although
reports, no doubt originating with her persecutors,
were circulated respecting my arrival in port, and
the disreputable life I was said to lead, she remained
faithful to me amid it all. Oh! what is like woman’s
love? Amid sorrow and joy; in sunshine or
storm; whether distant or near; in every varied circumstance
of life, it is the solace of our existence,
the green spot amid the arid deserts of the world.
Nothing can change it—nothing can dim its brightness.
Even injury fails to break down the love of
woman. You may neglect, you may abuse her, if
you will; but still, with a devotion not of this earth,
she clings to you, cheering you in distress, smiling
on you in joy, and amply repaid if she only win in
return one kind word, one look of approval. Thank
God! that, fallen as we are, there is left to us that
link of our diviner nature—the pure, deep, unchanging
love of woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With what joy did I hear that Beatrice was still
mine, wholly mine, and how ardently did I press her
to my bosom, invoking her again and again to repeat
the blessed words which assured me of her love!
Hours passed away as if they had been minutes.
And when at length I rose to depart, and, imprinting
another kiss on her but half averted lips, took my
leave with a promise to return again the ensuing
morning, my astonishment passed all bounds to learn
that noon had long since passed, and that the evening
was almost at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the short time that we remained in port,
I was daily with Beatrice, and when we parted she
pledged herself to be mine at the end of another
year, come what might. My heart, I will admit,
reproached me afterwards for winning this promise
from her, and inducing her to give up wealth and
luxury for the bare comforts an officer’s pay could
afford; and yet her love was such a priceless gem,
and she looked up to me with such unreserved devotedness,
that I could not regret a vow which ensured
me the right to protect her from the cold tempests
of the world. Besides, we were both young and full
of hope, and I trusted some fortunate event might
occur which would yet allow us to be united with
the concurrence of her friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle is suspected and watched by the colonial
authorities,” said Beatrice, as we parted, “and I
fear me that he is linked in with some of those who
have designs against the state. I tremble to think
what might be his fate if detected in any conspiracy
to restore the king’s authority.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear not, dearest,” I replied, “I will interest
Col. Moultrie in his favor, and besides, your uncle
must see the danger of any such attempt at present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet I have fearful forebodings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cheer up, sweet one, he has nothing to dread. But
now I must go. God bless you, Beatrice!” and I
kissed her fervently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She murmured something half inaudibly, returned
my parting embrace with a sigh, and, while a tear
stood in her eye, waved a final adieu with her kerchief.
In an hour the schooner had sailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had been at sea but a few days, having run
down the Bahamas in that time, when we spoke a
French merchantman, and obtained from him the intelligence
that an English ship, with a valuable cargo
and a large amount of specie, was then lying at
the port of ——, in one of the smaller islands.
She was well armed, however, and carried the crew
of a letter of marque. But the skipper instantly determined
on attempting her capture. Accordingly,
we bore up for the island within an hour after we
had spoken the merchantman, and having a favorable
breeze to second our wishes, we made the low
headlands of the place of our destination just as the
sun sank behind them into the western ocean. Not
wishing to be detected, we hauled off until evening,
spending the intervening time in preparing for the
adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was fortunately dark. There was no
moon, and a thick veil of vapors overhead effectually
shrouded the stars from sight. The seaboard was
lined with dusky clouds; the ocean heaved in gentle
undulations; and a light breeze murmured by, with a
low soft music in its tone, like the whisper of a
young girl to her lover. As the twilight deepened,
the shadowy outlines of the distant land became
more and more indistinct, until at length they were
merged in the obscurity of the whole western firmament.
No sound was heard over the vast expanse as
we resumed our course, and silently stretched up towards
the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nearly midnight when we reached the
mouth of the harbor. All within was still. The
town lay along the edge of the water, distinguishable
by its long line of flickering lamps; while a dark
mass on the left of the harbor betrayed the position
of the battery guarding the port. One or two small
coasting vessels were moored at the quay, and, a few
cables’ length out in the harbor, rode at anchor the
merchantman. He was in part protected by the
guns of the fort; but other means of defence had not
been forgotten, for his nettings were triced up, and
he swung at his anchor as if springs were on his
cables. A solitary lantern hung at his mast-head,
throwing a faint radiance around the otherwise shadowy
ship. Not a sound arose from his decks. Occasionally
a low murmur would float down from the
far-off town, or the cry of a sentry at the fort would
rise solemnly on the still night air; but except these
faint sounds, at long intervals apart, a deep, unbroken
silence buried the whole landscape in repose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pipe away the boats’ crews,” said the skipper,
when, everything having been planned, we had steered
our craft under the shadow of the huge cape, and
now lay to in our quiet nook, hidden from observation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boatswain issued his summons almost in a
whisper, and the men answered with unusual promptness.
In a few minutes the boats were manned, and
we were waiting with muffled oars for the signal.
We lingered only a moment to receive the last orders
of the captain, when, with a whispered “give way,”
the gallant fellows bent to the oars, and we shot
from the schooner’s side. In a few moments she
was lost in the gloom. I watched her through the
gathering night, as spar after spar faded into the obscurity,
until at length nothing could be seen of her
exquisite proportions but a dark and shapeless mass
of shadow; and at length, when I turned my eyes in
her direction again, after having had my attention
for a moment called away, even the slight outline of
her form had disappeared, and nothing but the
gloomy seaboard met my eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was now so dark that we could scarcely
see a fathom before us; but, guided by an old salt
who had been brought up on the island, and knew the
harbor as accurately as a scholar knows his horn
book, we boldly kept on our course. As we swept
around the headland, we perceived that the town, so
lately alive with lights, was now buried in a profound
darkness. The solitary lantern, however, still
burned at the fore-peak of the Englishman, like a
star hanging alone in the firmament, to guide us on
our way. Every eye was fixed on it as we rapidly
but noiselessly swept up towards the merchantman.
The fort was buried in gloom. The other vessels in
the harbor lay hidden in the palpable obscurity
ahead. No sound was heard, no object was seen, as
we moved on in our noiseless course. At length the
huge hull of the merchantman began to be indistinctly
visible upon our starboard bow, and, lying on our
oars for a moment, we held a short, eager consultation
on our future course. It was soon, however,
terminated. As yet we had remained undiscovered,
and as the slightest accident might betray us, not a
moment was to be lost if we would surprise the foe.
It had been arranged that I should dash into the
larboard side of the Englishman, while the two
other boats should attack him simultaneously on his
starboard bow and quarter; and accordingly, as my
companions sheered off, I gave a whispered order to
my men to pull their best, and the next instant we
were shooting with the rapidity of an arrow right on
to the foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The instant preceding the attack is always a thrilling
one. You know not but that in a few minutes
you may be in eternity, and as yet you are not carried
away with that reckless enthusiasm which, in
the heat of the contest, makes you insensible to
every thing but the struggle. On the present occasion
I felt as I had never felt before. The odds
against us were fearful, for the ship was admirably
defended, and we had every reason to believe that
her crew outnumbered our own. As I looked around
on my men, I saw more than one hardy veteran cast
an uneasy glance at the foe. But it was no time
now to pause. We had scarcely pulled a dozen
strokes, and were yet some distance from the ship,
when the sentry from her quarter cried out, “Boat
ahoy!” and then perceiving that we still advanced,
he fired his piece and gave the alarm. I saw the
moment for action had come. Disguise was now
useless. Instantaneously I forgot the feelings which
had just been passing through my mind, and, like a
war-horse starting at a trumpet, I sprang up in the
stern sheets, and waving my sword aloft, shouted,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give way, my lads—give way, and lay us
aboard the rascals—with a will, boys—pull!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if fired with an enthusiasm which nothing
might resist, my gallant fellows sprang to their oars
with renewed vigor at my words, until the oaken
blades almost snapped beneath their brawny arms;
and we were already within a few fathoms of the
ship’s quarter when a volley from the merchantman
hit the stroke-oarsman in front of me, and he fell
dead across the thwart. The boat staggered in her
course. I could hear our companions surging but a
short distance behind, and I burned to be the first to
mount the enemy’s deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On—on!” I shouted; “pull for your lives, my
lads—pull, pull!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thundering cheer burst from the brave veterans,
as they bent with even redoubled power to their task,
and with a few gigantic strokes sent us shooting upon
the quarters of the foe. Waving my sword above
my head, I sprang at once up the ship’s side, calling
on my crew to follow me. They needed not the invocation.
The boat had scarcely touched the vessel
before every man, cutlass in hand, was clambering
over the side of the foe; and in an instant, with one
simultaneous spring, old and young, officer and men,
we tumbled in upon the enemy. And like men they
met us. It was no child’s play—that conflict!
Fearfully outnumbering us, apprised of and ready for
our onset, fighting on their own decks too, and knowing
that succor was at hand from the fort even in
case of defeat, the crew of the Englishman met our
attack with an unbroken front, giving back blow for
blow and shout for shout. Short, wild and terrific
was the conflict. Conscious of the vicinity of the
other boats, the enemy wished to overcome us before
we could be succored; while we struggled as
desperately to maintain our footing until aid should
arrive. But our efforts were in vain. Pressing on
to us in dense, overpowering numbers, and hemming
us in on every quarter but that by which we had
boarded the ship, they seemed determined to drive
us into the ocean pell-mell, or slaughter us outright.
No quarter was asked or given. Man after man fell
around me in the vain attempt to maintain our footing.
Already I had received two cutlass wounds
myself. Our ranks were fearfully thinned. Yet still
I cheered on my men, determined rather to die at
bay than surrender or retreat. But all seemed in
vain. Several men had already fallen before
my arm, and the deck was slippery with the blood
of friend and foe; yet the enemy did not appear to
lessen in numbers. As fast as one man fell, another
filled his place. Despair took possession of us. I
saw nothing before us but a glorious death, and I determined
that it should be one long after to be talked
of by my countrymen. All this, however, had passed
almost in a minute. Suddenly I heard a cheer on
the starboard bow of the enemy, and as it rose clear
and shrill over all the din of the conflict, I recognised
the Fireflies clambering over the ship’s side
in that direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huzza! the day’s our own!” I shouted, in the
revulsion of feeling. “Come on, my lads, and let
us hew the scoundrels to the chine!” and, with another
wild huzza, I dashed like a madman upon the
cutlasses of the foe. My men followed me with the
fury of a whirlwind. Wild, terrible, overpowering
was that charge; fierce, desperate and relentless
was the resistance. The scene that ensued eternity
will not eradicate from my memory. Hand to hand
and foot to foot we fought, each man striving with
his opponent, conscious that life or death depended
on the issue: while swords clashed, pistols exploded,
shouts rent the air, and blood flowed on every hand
as if it had been water. Now the foe yielded, and
now we retired in turn. Swaying to and fro, striking
around pell-mell, thrusting, parrying, hewing, wrestling
in the death-grip, or hurling the fallen from our
path, now clearing our way by main force, and now
breaking the enemy’s front by a deceptive retreat,
we succeeded at length in driving the foe back in a
broken mass on their assailants from the bow. Then
they rallied, and, with the fury of tigers at bay, returned
to the charge. If ever men fought like demons,
they did. As they grew more and more desperate,
they fairly howled with rage. Their curses
were terrific. God help me from ever witnessing
such a sight again! I saw that it only needed another
vigorous charge to complete their defeat, and
rallying my little band around me once more, though
every man of them was wounded, we dashed on to
the foe, determined to cut our way through to our
friends, or drive the enemy down the hatchway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once more, my boys, once more—huzza for
liberty!—on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, ye rebel knaves!” growled the leader
of the British, and striking at me with his cutlass, to
challenge me to single combat, he roared, “Take
that, ye hell-hound.” One of my men sprang to my
aid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back—back!” I shouted, “leave him to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, God’s curse be on you—” but his words
were lost in the clash of the conflict. For a moment
I thought he was more than my match, but his very
rage overreached itself, and failing to guard himself
sufficiently, he exposed his person, and the next instant
my sword passed through his body. He fell backwards
without a groan. His men saw him fall, and
a score of weapons were pointed at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down with him—hew him to the ground,” roared
the British.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah for Parker!—beat back the villains!”
thundered my own men, and the contest, which had
paused during the combat between the fallen chief
and myself, now raged with redoubled frenzy, the
whole fury of the enemy being directed against myself.
I remember shouts, curses, and groans, the
clash of cutlasses and the roar of fire-arms, and then
comes a faint memory of a sharp pain in my side,
succeeded by a reeling in my brain, and a sensation
of staggering, as if about to fall. After that all is
blank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I recovered my senses, I was lying on the
quarter deck, while the cool night breeze swept deliciously
over my fevered brow, and my ears were
soothed with the gentle ripple of the waters as the
ship moved on her course. A solitary star, struggling
through a rent in the clouds overhead, shone
calmly down on me. I turned uneasily around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, Parker?” said the voice of the
lieutenant, approaching me. “We are nearing the
schooner rapidly, when you’ll have your wound attended
to—I bandaged it as well as I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” I said, faintly. “But have you
really brought off the prize?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay,” said he, laughing, “we got off, although
they hailed cannon balls around us like sugar-plums
at a carnival in Rome. Never before did I
run such a gauntlet. But the sleepy fellows did not
get properly awake until we had made sail—had
they opened their fire at once, they might have sent
us to Davy Jones’ locker in a trice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the enemy’s crew?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All snug below hatches, every mother’s son of
them. They fought like devils, and came within an
ace of beating us. But, faith, yonder is the old
schooner. Ship, ahoy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were soon aboard. My wound proved a serious,
though not a dangerous one, and for several
weeks I was confined to my hammock.</p>

<div><h1><a id='nia'></a>A DAY AT NIAGARA.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. E. C. STEDMAN.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, here’s an evil of rail-road travelling that
I never thought of before!” screamed a bright girl,
with pouting, rosy lips and a dimpled chin, at the
risque of spoiling as sweet a voice as ever warbled
“Away with Melancholy,” on a May morning; addressing
her words to our good cousin, who had taken
upon himself the responsible charge of escorting a
party of ladies, (among whom were the fair speaker,
his sister, and my fortunate self,) to see the great
‘lion’ of this western world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say that we are within five miles of Niagara,
yet I cannot hear its voice for the eternal
gabble, gabble of this locomotive. Why, all my
dreams have been associated with the geographic
recollections of childhood, which invariably said,
‘The roar of the cataract may be heard distinctly at
the distance of fifteen or twenty miles.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget,” replied her brother, “that it is
when those wise assurances were written, which
make the eyes of the school-girl stand out ‘as visibly
as letters on a sign,’ that this rapid, noisy mode
of travelling was unthought of: wait a little, my
sweet sis., till we reach the point of our destination,
and Niagara’s thundering bass will sound all the
mightier, for bursting suddenly upon your ear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While these remarks were passing, we were nearing
the end of our journey; and on reaching the
depot, our party was among the foremost to leave
the puffing, snorting, “black poney” behind, as we
turned our faces towards the hotel. But neither my
fair cousin nor myself seemed <span class='it'>astounded</span> at the noise
of the cataract; much to the surprise of her brother.
The truth was, that in this particular of <span class='it'>sound</span> our
“loud expectations” exceeded the reality; though it
may as well be remembered here as elsewhere, that
before leaving Niagara, our ears <span class='it'>were</span> “filled with
hearing,” no less than were our “eyes satisfied with
seeing.” The sun was first hiding his face behind
the golden curtain of a July evening, and tea already
sending its grateful fragrance from the ample board,
as we reached “The Cataract House;” so it was
agreed that we should refresh ourselves with a dish
of the green beverage, before sallying out for a peep
at the Falls:—furthermore, that until then, no one
of our party should approach a certain window which
commanded a view of the rapids, upon the penalty
of our good-natured cousin’s displeasure; and as we
had one and all promised obedience to his wishes,
each poised herself on the tip-toe of curiosity, long
enough to swallow a boiling draught, at the expense
of sore, though not <span class='it'>disabled</span> tongues, for some days
thereafter. We were, however, too unmerciful to
allow our gallant the comforts of his cigar after tea;
but by sundry hints, in the form of bonnets and
shawls, compelled his politeness to yield to our impatience
for the evening ramble. Our footsteps were
first directed to the bridge which extends over the
boiling, angry rapids, to Goat Island. Even here, it
would seem that as much of the awful, the sublime,
and the beautiful, had met together, as human eyes
could endure to look upon! As we leaned over the
railing of the bridge, (holding on instinctively with
convulsive grasp,) and surveyed the yawning whirlpools
beneath, encompassed by the ever-restless
foam, I, for one, thought I had never seen any thing
terrific before! But from the imperfect view of the
falls, which the gathering shades of twilight and the
American side gave us that evening, my “first impressions”
were those of bitter disappointment. “And
is this the end of all my vast imaginings?” said I,
in haste to myself, but breathed it not aloud; for,
indeed, even then and there, the scene was grand and
imposing: so I held my peace, resolving to await
the morning beams, for its rainbow crown, and retire
to my pillow <span class='it'>opinionless</span>, touching the glories of the
grand cataract.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun looked down upon us the next morning
without the shadow of a cloud between, and preparations
commenced at an early hour, for a day at
Niagara. Much to our delight, we found a familiar
party of ladies and gentlemen, at a sister hotel, who
had arrived during the night, and would join us in the
pleasures of the day. As it happened that the gentlemen
of said party outnumbered the ladies, the <span class='it'>fair</span>
responsibilities of our obliging cousin (who had performed
the part of “beau-general” much to the credit
of his gallantry) were <span class='it'>fairly</span> divided with the other
beaux, and all things being arranged, each lady could
boast of her own protector. I know of nothing that
quickens the pleasing excitement of these excursions
more than an unexpected recruit of acquaintances
and friends. Never was there a gayer or happier
little company than left the “Cataract House” that
shadowless summer morning, to cross the green
waters of Niagara river for the Canada side. Oh!
how those bright faces come up before me now, as
if among the vivid recollections of yesterday! There
was the brilliant Mrs. —— with her raven curls,
matchless form, and “dangerous eyes of jet,” ever
and anon returning a dazzling smile for the involuntary
gaze of admiration. And what coquette by <span class='it'>nature</span>
ever learned, until she had been the happy wife
and mother <span class='it'>more</span> than two years, to confine her favorable
glances to <span class='it'>one</span> beloved object. Albeit the
beautiful Mrs. —— is “a jewel of a wife,” though
I heard her adoring husband confess that very day,
that she “caught” him “with her eyes!” There,
too, in striking contrast, was the gentle wife of our
happy cousin, with her hazel “eyes, like shaded
water;” the carnation of modesty on her cheeks, and
“the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit” beaming
on her brow. And then the fair Miss ——, only
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. ——, from New York, who
were exposing, for the first time, their fragile flower
of sixteen summers, whose delicate complexion, and
lily hands, needed none to affirm that “the winds of
heaven never visited her too roughly;” but whose
chief attraction seemed in some way connected with
the appellation of “heiress!” So no doubt thought
a whiskered “fortune-hunter,” who, by dint of bows
and smiles, had contrived to insinuate himself into
the good graces of our party, and played the devoted
to Miss ——, after the most approved fashion. To
say nothing of the pretty sister of our cousin, with
her tiny feet—“the lightest and gentlest that ever
from the heath-flower brushed the dew!” Nor of
the radiant and fascinating belle of ——, who had
already commenced a flirtation with the rich southerner,
who was her chosen <span class='it'>knight</span> for the day. Nor
of other laughing eyes and mirth-stirring spirits that
made up the party. But, alas! the shadow of death
falls ever upon life’s retrospect picture. Of one individual,
whose gallantry, good sense and extraordinary
musical powers, rendered him a favorite of the
fair, on that occasion, may it now be said, “the
places that knew him shall know him no more.” In
early manhood, and in a stranger’s grave, sleeps he
whose active step, whose buoyant spirits, whose
melody of song and sparkling wit concealed from us
the insatiate disease, whose slow, sure worm had
even then fastened upon his vitals. Consumption sent
him to the balmy south, there to find a resting place
’mid orange groves and perpetual-blooming flowers.
Peace be with the ashes of the early, the gifted
dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner was our little barge on the centre of the
rapid tide, and the eye glanced upward and round
about, than a scene of magnificence and glory burst
upon us, which it had “never entered into the heart
to conceive!” Many have attempted to describe it;
but if the ablest pen of the most ready writer hath
failed to embrace half its wondrous beauties, let not
this humble pen dare to desecrate what for sublimity
and loveliness is verily <span class='it'>indescribable</span>! To us it
seemed that “the fountains of the deep were again
broken up”—as if old <span class='it'>Ocean</span> was pouring forth his
deep green floods into that awful abyss, so wide, so
vast, so terrible was their rush to the brink—so
mighty and resistless their plunge into the boiling
chasm! There hung the rainbow, with God’s promise
in its hues of beauty—</p>

<p class='line0'>“That arch, where angel-forms might lean,</p>
<p class='line0'>And view the wonders of the mighty scene!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>On reaching the Canada side, our first “post of observation”
was Table Rock. The picture it presents—who
shall paint it? The most striking feature
of the whole is the vast <span class='it'>quantity</span> of water which
pours unceasing and unspent, and its consequent
deeply emerald hue as it passes the rocks, before
breaking in its fall to the pure, amber-shaded foam,
which sends up an eternal incense of spray to
Heaven. Another feature of beauty which arrested
our attention was the meeting of the floods at the
termination of the “Horse-shoe Fall,” where an angle
of the rocks causes a continual <span class='it'>embrace of the
waters</span>. The eye could scarce weary in viewing this
<span class='it'>one</span> beauty of the scene; but before the mighty
<span class='it'>whole</span>, awe-struck, the heart could only bow in silent
adoration to that Great Being who made it all, for
“the spirit of <span class='sc'>God</span> moved on the face of the waters!”
We next ascended the craggy steep to a wide-extended
plain above, where are placed the barracks of
the “Forty-third regiment of Her Majesty’s troops.”
Fortunately for us, the day was one of regular review,
and the whole regiment was out on duty. As
we reached the brow of the hill, where, on the one
side, was Niagara in all its glory, and on the other
an extensive military display of red coats and arms
of steel flashing in the sunlight, I thought that Nature
and Art needed no embellishment from the pen
of Fancy—“ ’Twas like enchantment all!” While
in the full enjoyment of this glorious scene, her Majesty’s
well-disciplined band played the familiar air
of “God save the Queen!” as to <span class='it'>us</span> it was never
played before, and my heart vibrated with as much
joy as it ever felt at the sound of our national air,
“Hail Columbia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our party returned to the hotel at sunset, all
uniting in the opinion that it is impossible to anticipate
too much of enjoyment at Niagara, so far as it
respects the marvellous and beautiful in nature, and
only regretting that we could not pass a month, instead
of a day, with its scenes around us. A few
hours, previous to our departure the following morning,
were spent in exploring Goat Island, so far as
our limited time would allow. ’Tis in sooth a “fairy
isle,” lashed day and night by the untiring rapids,
and affording various and beautiful views of the great
cataract it divides. The luxuriant foliage of its majestic
trees shelters the admirer of the scenes around
from the noonday heat, and the odors from its garden
of flowers regale his senses the while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We bade a reluctant adieu to Niagara, calling to
mind all the imaginations that the heart had devised—all
the descriptions we had heard from
others’ lips—but with the words of “the Queen of
the East” on our own, “<span class='it'>The half was not told
me</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By way of concluding this imperfect sketch, we
add some few lines, which were written in despite of
a resolution most religiously <span class='it'>made</span> against such a
presumptive measure; for, somehow or other, the
humblest, as well as the loftiest pen, will attempt in
numbers to express the <span class='it'>un</span>numbered thoughts and
“strange, which crowd into the brain” at Niagara.
And while this prince of cataracts flows on, its terrific
beauties will be still the oft-told but unspent
theme of the “spirit-stirring muse.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='wil'></a>WILLIS GAYLORD CLARK.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Since our last number went to press, we have been called
upon to mourn the death of <span class='sc'>Willis Gaylord Clark</span>, one
of the contributors to this Magazine, and a poet of unusual
sweetness, elegance, melody and pathos. He died, in his
thirty-second year, of pulmonary consumption. He had
more than once been almost prostrated by this fell disease,
but his constitution had rallied against its attacks, and he,
as well as his friends, entertained hopes of his recovery; but
about two months before his death, the disease apparently
returned with renewed violence, and, after sinking gradually
beneath its power, Mr. Clark’s life terminated on Sunday,
the 13th of June, 1841.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a man, Mr. Clark was universally esteemed. His
warm heart, frank nature, and social qualities endeared him
to all his friends, and he has left a blank in the little circle
which he was wont to grace. To the last he enjoyed the
society of his friends. He breathed to them the wish that
no venomous tongue should be suffered to insult his fame
when he was dead, and thus rob his orphan boy of his
father’s only heritage—his name. God knows, the heart
that could entertain aught evil towards the departed deserves
not the companionship or sympathy of mankind. The
dying moments of Mr. Clark were filled with the memory of
his lost wife—to whom he has written some of the sweetest
verses in the language—and his parting request was that
he should be buried by her side, at the same hour of the day
at which she was interred. Need we say his request was
religiously fulfilled?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The closing days of the poet are finely drawn in the following
lines, for which we are indebted to Robert Morris,
Esq., another of our valued contributors, and one of the
circle of Mr. Clark’s friends. They need no eulogy at our
hands. They will commend themselves to all who loved the
departed, or admire true poetry.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>&ensp;A DEATH SCENE IN THE CHAMBER OF A POET.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>Come hither, friend! My voice grows thin and weak—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>My limbs are feeble, and I feel that Death</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Will soon achieve his conquest. Look not sad!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The being best beloved has gone before—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Why should <span class='it'>I</span> tarry here? An angel form</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Beckons me on. Amid my morning dreams,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I hear <span class='it'>her</span> voice and see her starry eyes!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That voice so full of woman tenderness;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Those eyes that mirrored an unsullied soul!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Then look not sad! My peace is made with God,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And in the hope, which is the dawn of Heaven—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The Christian’s hope—I will a little hence</p>
<p class='dramaline'>On my mysterious journey. Soon—how soon!—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The truth will break upon me! The dim stars,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Which now, this mellow night, like sands of gold,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Glitter amid the distance—it may be</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That I may pass their confines on my course;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That peopled worlds may greet my spirit’s gaze!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Look, gentle friend, how brightly do they shine!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>How like to living things! How beautiful!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>How more than wonderful the mighty hand</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That placed them there, all radiant with light!</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;Oh, God! in whose high presence soon my soul</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Will stand uncovered, what a worm am I</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Amid thy wonders vast and infinite!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;And yet I feel th’ immortal burns within—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;The quenchless light of an eternal soul!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Yes! as the frame decays; as this frail dust</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Sinks to its native earth, the spirit’s wings</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Unfold, and all within seems eager for the flight!</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>My voice is almost lost. Friend!—faithful friend,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Long tried and well beloved—before I leave</p>
<p class='dramaline'>This summer scene of earth, yon fields and flowers—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Alas! like youth and life, they soon will fade—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I have a boon to crave. My boy, my only boy,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Will soon be fatherless! Forgive this tear;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>It is among the last.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Hither, my child!</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>There lives his mother’s image—her soft eyes,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>So large and full and dove-like; her brown hair,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>So rich and silken, and her cheek of rose!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Oh! what a fate was hers! But yesterday,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>All youth and hope and beauty; and to-day,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A banquet for the cold and creeping worm!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But far above the grave her spirit dwells,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Among the white-robed circles of the blest:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In that bright clime where Faith and Fancy soar,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And Love and Hope and Joy walk hand in hand.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>But to the boon.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I would not, when my dust</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lies still and cold, leave bitter memories.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I would not leave a wound in any breast,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But fain with all the world would die in peace,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Forgiving all, and asking all forgiveness.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The only legacy that I may leave</p>
<p class='dramaline'>My idol boy, is a weak dream of fame:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A phantom that has cheated me of life,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And fails me now, I fear, before the grave.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And yet, how that wild dream, tempting and bright,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Has spanned my youthful life, as does the bow</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The summer storm! And now, e’en while I gaze.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And feel the mortal passing slowly off,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>How dust still clings to dust, and a desire</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Burns at my breast, that justice may be done</p>
<p class='dramaline'>My memory!—that he, in after time—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>(Poor child, how little recks he of this scene!—)</p>
<p class='dramaline'>May speak his father’s name with love and pride.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>A hand—a friendly hand!—mine eyes grow dim—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Clark possessed poetic talents of no ordinary merit.
He belonged to the school of Goldsmith and Pope, rather
than to that of Byron or Coleridge. He was more remarkable
for sweetness than passion, for melody than force, for
fancy than imagination. The rank to which he belonged
was not the highest, but in that rank he occupied one of the
foremost stations. He was distinguished for his grace and
euphony. Few men have written so elegantly as Mr. Clark;
no man has excelled him in the melody of numbers. He
obviously devoted the greatest attention to the composition
of poetry, and no piece left his hand until it had received its
utmost polish. There was a deep abiding sense of religion
in his compositions which commend them to every heart.
He was indeed almost the first poet to render the poetry of
religion attractive; for Young, Cowper, Wordsworth, and
even Milton, too often fail in this. But Mr. Clark was always
successful, breathing, as he did, aspirations after a
higher and better state of being, and emulating, if that were
possible, the rapt enthusiasm of the Hebrew poet, when
dreaming of the “better land”—that land to which he has
now followed his long-wept wife. Yes! he has gone—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prevailing attributes and domestic economy of fishes
may be described as exactly the reverse of those of birds.
These gay and airy creatures possess the power of surveying
distinctly, at a glance, an immeasurable extent of horizon;
their acute perception of sound appreciates all intonations,
and their glad voices are exquisitely skilled in their
production. Though their bills are hard, and their bodies
closely covered by down and feathers, they are by no means
deficient in the sense of touch. They enjoy all the delights
of conjugal and parental affection, and perform their incumbent
duties with devotedness and courage. They cherish
and defend their offspring, and will sometimes even die in
their defence; and of all the wonderful labors of instinctive
art, none is so beautiful as the formation of their mossy
dwellings. With what deep and continuous affection does
the female brood over her cherished treasures!—how unwearied
is the gallant male in his tender assiduities, and
with what melodious love does he outpour that rich and varied
song by which he seeks to soothe her sedentary task!</p>

<p class='noindent'>the wild and fearful lapwing, with graceful crest and dark
dilated eye, are each and all enslaved for many a long-enduring
season by this love of offspring, and toil in its support
from dewy morning until latest eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is far otherwise with our voiceless dwellers in the
deep, who exhibit but few attachments, are conversant with
no interchanging language, and cherish no warm affections.
Constructing no dwellings, they merely shelter themselves
from danger among the cavernous rocks of the ocean, in the
silent depths of lakes, or beneath the murky shade of the
overhanging banks of rivers; and the cravings of hunger
alone seem to exercise a frequent or influential action over
their monotonous movements. We must not, however, conceive
that the life of fishes is not one of enjoyment, for we
know that the Great Creator “careth for all his creatures;”
and it ought perhaps rather to be said that we cannot appreciate
the nature of their feelings, than that they are in any
way fore-doomed to a negation of pleasure. Assuredly,
however, the hand of nature has been most prodigal in bestowing
on their external aspect every variety of adornment.
Their special forms are infinite, their proportions often most
elegant, their colors lively and diversified—and nothing
seems wanting, either in their shape or structure, to excite
the unfeigned admiration of mankind. Indeed, it almost appears
as if this prodigality of beauty was intended solely for
such an end. The brightness of metallic splendor, the sparkling
brilliancy of precious gems, the milder effulgence of the
hues of flowers, all combine to signalize fishes as among the
most beautiful objects of creation. When newly withdrawn
from their native element, or still gliding submerged amid
its liquid coolness, their colors, fixed or iridescent, are seen
mingling in spots, or bands, or broader flashes—always elegant
and symmetrical, sometimes richly contrasted, sometimes
gradually softened into each other, and in all cases
harmonizing with a chaste fulness of effect which Titian and
Rubens might envy, but could never equal. For what reason,
then, it has been asked, has all this adornment been
bestowed on creatures which can scarcely perceive each
other amid the dim perpetual twilight of the deep? Shakspeare
has already said that there are “more things in <span class='it'>heaven</span>
and <span class='it'>earth</span> than are dreamt of in our philosophy;” and we
fear it is no answer to the foregoing question to add, that
the same observation applies with even greater truth to the
“<span class='it'>waters beneath the earth</span>.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>NUTRITION AND GROWTH OF FISHES.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The nutritive functions of fishes follow the same order of
progression as those of the other classes of the vertebrated
kingdom. They seize, and in some measure divide, their
food with their teeth; they digest it in the stomach, from
whence it passes into the intestinal canal, where it receives
a supply of bile from the liver, and frequently a liquid similar
to that of the pancreas; the nutritive juices, absorbed by
vessels analogous to lacteals, and probably taken up in part
also directly by the veins, are mingled with the venous
blood which is flowing towards the heart, from whence it is
pushed to the branchiæ, in which, coming in contact with
the water, it is converted into arterial blood, and then proceeds
to the nourishment of the whole body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fishes are in general extremely voracious, and the rule of
“eat or be eaten,” applies to them with unusual force.
They are almost constantly engaged either in the active pursuit
or patient waiting for their prey—their degree of power
in its capture depending, of course, on the dimensions of
the mouth and throat, and the strength of the teeth and jaws.
If the teeth are sharp and curved, they are capable of seizing
and securing either a large and fleshy bait, or the slenderest
and most agile animal; if these parts are broad and strong,
they are able to bruise the hardest aliment; if they are feeble
or almost wanting, they are only serviceable in procuring
some inert or unresisting prey. Fishes indeed, in most instances,
show but little choice in the selection of their food,
and their digestive powers are so strong and rapid as speedily
to dissolve all animal substances. They greedily swallow
other fishes, notwithstanding the sharp spines or bony
ridges with which they may be armed; they attack and devour
crabs and shell-fish, gulping them entire, without the
least regard to the feelings of their families; they do not object
occasionally to swallow the young even of their own
species, and the more powerful kinds carry their warfare
into other kingdoms of nature, and revel on rats, reptiles and
young ducklings, to say nothing, gentle reader, of the ferocious
shark, which not seldom makes a meal even of the
lord of the creation. A particular friend of ours has his
right leg in the West Indies, in consequence of an act of aggression
alike unpleasant and uncalled for, and which a
Christian-minded pedestrian finds it easier to forgive than
forget. The species which live chiefly on vegetables are
few in number, almost all fishes preferring pork to green
peas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The growth of these creatures depends greatly on the nature
and amount of food, different individuals of the same
species exhibiting a large disparity in their dimensions.
They grow less rapidly in small ponds or shallow streams,
than in large lakes and deep rivers. We once kept a minnow,
little more than half an inch long, in a small glass vessel
for a period of two years, during which time there was
no perceptible increase in its dimensions. Had it continued
in its native stream, subjected to the fattening influence of
a continuous flow of water, and a consequent increase in
the quantity and variety of its natural food, its cubic dimensions
would probably have been twenty times greater; yet
it must have attained, long prior to the lapse of a couple of
years, to the usual period of the adult state. The growth itself
seems to continue, under favorable circumstances, for a
length of time, and we can scarcely set bounds to, certainly
we know not with precision, the utmost range of the specific
size of fishes. Salmon sometimes attain a weight of eighty
pounds and upwards, and the giant pike of Kaiserslautern is
alleged to have measured nineteen feet, and to have weighed
350 pounds. No doubt, an incorrect allegation does not in
any way increase the actual size of fishes, and few people
now-a-days can take exact cognizance of what was done at
Mannheim in the year 1497; but, even in these degenerate
days, amid our own translucent waters, and among species
in no way remarkable for their ordinary dimensions, we ever
and anon meet with ancient individuals which vastly exceed
the usual weight and measure of their kind. But, in spite
of this, let no angler, whether in the bloom of early youth,
the power of matured manhood, or with the silver locks of
“hoar antiquity” above his wrinkled brow, ever induce
within himself, or express to others, the belief that, at all
times and places, he is perpetually catching enormous trouts
in vast numbers, because we happen to know that this is not
the case. We don’t insist upon any one weighing every
fish he captures, but we insist that no one, after jerking out
a few pair, will maintain next morning, or even that very
night, that he has had a most toilsome but very glorious day,
and has killed five dozen and four of the finest trouts the
human eye ever gazed upon. “All men are liars”—and
several anglers—is a proposition the exact import of which
depends much on the mode of construction.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE MUSCULAR MOVEMENTS OF FISHES.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The vertebral column, composed of numerous articulations,
united by cartilages which permit of certain movements,
curves with great facility from side to side; but the
vertical motion is much more restricted, chiefly in consequence
of the projection of the upper and under spiny processes
of the vertebræ. The great organ of movement in all
fishes is the tail. The muscles, by which it is brought into
play, extend in lengthened masses on either side of the vertebral
column. The body, being supported chiefly by the
swimming bladder, (which, however, is absent in several
species), is propelled forward by the rapid flexure of the extremity
acting laterally upon the resistance offered by the
water. Generally speaking, neither the pectoral nor the
ventral fins are of any material use during swift progressive
motion; they rather serve to balance the body, or to aid its
gentler movements while in a state of comparative repose.
In <span class='it'>flying fishes</span>, as they are called, the pectoral fins are of
such great length and expansion as to support these creatures
in the air; and the strength of muscular action might
probably suffice even for a longer flight, but for the necessity
of constant moisture for the purposes of respiration. The
drying of the gills in an individual of this class is attended
by results analogous to those produced in the case of a land
animal; and a flying fish is obliged to descend to respire, in
like manner as a swimming quadruped, or disguised mammiferous
animal, as we may term a whale, is under the necessity
of ascending for the same purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heads of fishes exercise but a slight movement independent
of the rest of the body, but the jaws, opercular
bones, branchial arches, and other parts, are very free in
their motions. The muscles, like those of other vertebrated
animals, are composed of fleshy fibres more or less colored,
and of tendonous fibres of a white or silvery aspect. With
the exception, however, of certain spinal muscles, which
are sometimes of a deep red, the flesh of fishes is much
paler than that of quadrupeds, and still more so than that of
birds. In several species it is even entirely white.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SENSES OF FISHES.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>As fishes respire through the intervention of water alone,
that is, as they can scarcely avail themselves, in rendering
their blood <span class='it'>arterial</span>, of anything more than the small portion
of oxygen contained in the air which is suspended in
the water, their blood is necessarily cold, and the general
energy and activity of their senses are by no means so great
as those of quadrupeds and birds. Their brain also, though
of similar composition, is proportionally much smaller,
whether as compared with the total size of the body, with
the mass of nerves which proceed from it, or with the cavity
of the cranium in which it is contained. In the turbot
(<span class='it'>Gadus lota</span>) for example, the weight of the brain to that of
the spinal marrow is ascertained to be as 8 to 12, and to that
of the whole body as 1 to 720; and it has been ascertained
that the brain of a pike, weighed in proportion to the whole
body, is as 1 to 1305. Now, in many small birds, the brain,
viewed in relation to the rest of the body, is equal to a twentieth
part. In the generality of fishes, the spinal cord extends
along the whole of the caudal vertebræ, and it is thus
that it preponderates over the brain; but the fishing frog, or
sea devil (<span class='it'>Lophius piscatorius</span>), the moon fish (<span class='it'>Lampris
guttatus</span>), and a few others, form exceptions to this rule,
the spinal marrow disappearing before it reaches the eighth
vertebra. The brain of fishes by no means fills up the cavity
of the cranium; and the interval between the <span class='it'>pia mater</span>,
which envelopes the brain itself, and the <span class='it'>dura mater</span>, which
lines the interior of the skull, is occupied only by a loose
cellulosity, frequently impregnated by an oil, or sometimes,
as in the sturgeon and thunny, by a more compact fatty matter.
It has also been remarked that this void between the
cranium and the brain is much less in young subjects than
in adults; from which it may be inferred that the brain does
not increase in an equal proportion with the rest of the body.
Cuvier, in fact, has found its dimensions nearly the same in
different individuals—of the same species—of which the
general size of one was double that of the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although we should be sorry to lower the subjects of our
present observation in the estimation of society, we think it
undeniable that, of all vertebrated animals, fishes exhibit
the smallest apparent symptoms of refined sensibility.
Having no elastic air to act upon, they are necessarily mute,
or nearly so, and all the sweet sensations which the delightful
faculty of voice has called into being among the higher
tribes, are to them unknown. Their glazed, immovable
eyes, their fixed and bony faces, admit of no playful range
in their physiognomical expression, of no variation connected
with emotion. Their ears, surrounded on every side by
the bones of the cranium, destitute of external conch, without
any internal cochlea, and composed merely of certain
sacks and membranous canals, scarcely suffice for the perception
of the loudest sounds. Yet they will sink affrighted
into the darksome depths of lakes, beneath the banks of
rivers, or in oceans blue profound, when the “sky lowers
and mutters thunder,” and with elemental fierceness the
sheeted lightning flashes broad and bright above their liquid
dwellings.</p>

<span class='it'>Philadelphia: Printed by J. W. Macclefield.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A satire, professedly such, at the present day, and especially
by an American writer, is a welcome novelty, indeed.
We have really done very little in the line upon this side of
the Atlantic—nothing, certainly, of importance—Trumbull’s
clumsy poem and Halleck’s “Croakers” to the contrary
notwithstanding. Some things we have produced, to
be sure, which were excellent in the way of burlesque,
without intending a syllable that was not utterly solemn and
serious. Odes, ballads, songs, sonnets, epics, and epigrams,
possessed of this unintentional excellence, we could have no
difficulty in designating by the dozen; but, in the matter of
directly-meant and genuine satire, it cannot be denied that
we are sadly deficient. Although, as a literary people, however,
we are not exactly Archilocuses—although we have
no pretensions to the ηχεηντες ιαμβοι—although, in short, we
are no satirists ourselves, there can be no question that we
answer sufficiently well as subjects for satire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We repeat, that we are glad to see this book of Mr. Wilmer’s;
first, because it is something new under the sun;
secondly, because, in many respects, it is well executed;
and, thirdly, because, in the universal corruption and rigmarole
amid which we gasp for breath, it is really a pleasant
thing to get even one accidental whiff of the unadulterated
air of <span class='it'>truth</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “Quacks of Helicon,” as a poem and otherwise, has
many defects, and these we shall have no scruple in pointing
out—although Mr. Wilmer is a personal friend of our
own;<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> and we are happy and proud to say so—but it has also
many remarkable merits—merits which it will be quite
useless for those aggrieved by the satire—quite useless for
any <span class='it'>clique</span>, or set of <span class='it'>cliques</span>, to attempt to frown down, or
to affect not to see, or to feel, or to understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Its prevalent blemishes are referrible chiefly to the leading
sin of <span class='it'>imitation</span>. Had the work been composed professedly
in paraphrase of the whole manner of the sarcastic
epistles of the times of Dryden and Pope, we should have
pronounced it the most ingenious and truthful thing of the
kind upon record. So close is the copy, that it extends to
the most trivial points—for example to the old forms of
punctuation. The turns of phraseology, the tricks of rhythm,
the arrangement of the paragraphs, the general conduct of
the satire—everything—all—are Dryden’s. We cannot
deny, it is true, that the satiric model of the days in question
is insusceptible of improvement, and that the modern
author who deviates therefrom, must necessarily sacrifice
something of merit at the shrine of originality. Neither can
we shut our eyes to the fact, that the imitation, in the present
case, has conveyed, in full spirit, the higher qualities, as
well as, in rigid letter, the minor elegances and general
peculiarities of the author of “Absalom and Achitophel.”
We have here the bold, vigorous, and sonorous verse, the
biting sarcasm, the pungent epigrammatism, the unscrupulous
directness, as of old. Yet it will not do to forget that
Mr. Wilmer has been <span class='it'>shown how</span> to accomplish these things.
He is thus only entitled to the praise of a close observer, and
of a thoughtful and skilful copyist. The images are, to be
sure, his own. They are neither Pope’s, nor Dryden’s, nor
Rochester’s, nor Churchill’s—but they are moulded in the
identical mould used by these satirists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This servility of imitation has seduced our author into
errors which his better sense should have avoided. He sometimes
mistakes intention; at other times he copies faults,
confounding them with beauties. In the opening of the
poem, for example, we find the lines—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Against usurpers, Olney, I declare</p>
<p class='line0'>A righteous, just, and patriotic war.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The rhymes <span class='it'>war</span> and <span class='it'>declare</span> are here adopted from Pope,
who employs them frequently; but it should have been remembered
that the modern relative pronunciation of the two
words differs materially from the relative pronunciation of
the era of the “Dunciad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are also sure that the gross obscenity, the filth—we
can use no gentler name—which disgraces the “Quacks of
Helicon,” cannot be the result of innate impurity in the
mind of the writer. It is but a part of the slavish and indiscriminating
imitation of the Swift and Rochester school. It
has done the book an irreparable injury, both in a moral and
pecuniary view, without effecting anything whatever on the
score of sarcasm, vigor or wit. “Let what is to be said, be
said plainly.” True; but let nothing vulgar be <span class='it'>ever</span> said,
or conceived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In asserting that this satire, even in its mannerism, has
imbued itself with the full spirit of the polish and of the
pungency of Dryden, we have already awarded it high
praise. But there remains to be mentioned the far loftier
merit of speaking fearlessly the truth, at an epoch when
truth is out of fashion, and under circumstances of social
position which would have deterred almost any man in our
community from a similar Quixotism. For the publication
of the “Quacks of Helicon,”—a poem which brings under
review, by name, most of our prominent <span class='it'>literati</span>, and treats
them, generally, as they deserve (what treatment could be
more bitter?)—for the publication of this attack, Mr. Wilmer,
whose subsistence lies in his pen, has little to look for—apart
from the silent respect of those at once honest and
timid—but the most malignant open or covert persecution.
For this reason, and because it is the truth which he has
spoken, do we say to him from the bottom of our hearts,
“God speed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We repeat it:—<span class='it'>it is</span> the truth which he has spoken, and
who shall contradict us? He has said unscrupulously what
every reasonable man among us has long known to be “as
true as the Pentateuch”—that, as a literary people, we are
one vast perambulating humbug. He has asserted that we
are <span class='it'>clique</span>-ridden, and who does not smile at the obvious
truism of that assertion? He maintains that chicanery is,
with us, a far surer road than talent to distinction in letters.
Who gainsays this? The corrupt nature of our ordinary
criticism has become notorious. Its powers have been
prostrated by its own arm. The intercourse between critic
and publisher, as it now almost universally stands, is comprised
either in the paying and pocketing of black mail, as
the price of a simple forbearance, or in a direct system of
petty and contemptible bribery, properly so called—a system
even more injurious than the former to the true interests
of the public, and more degrading to the buyers and sellers
of good opinion, on account of the more positive character
of the service here rendered for the consideration received.
We laugh at the idea of any denial of our assertions upon
this topic; they are infamously true. In the charge of general
corruption there are undoubtedly many noble exceptions
to be made. There are, indeed, some very few editors, who,
maintaining an entire independence, will receive no books
from publishers at all, or who receive them with a perfect
understanding, on the part of these latter, that an unbiassed
<span class='it'>critique</span> will be given. But these cases are insufficient to
have much effect on the popular mistrust: a mistrust
heightened by late exposure of the machinations of <span class='it'>coteries</span>
in New York—<span class='it'>coteries</span> which, at the bidding of leading
booksellers, manufacture, as required from time to time, a
pseudo-public opinion by wholesale, for the benefit of any
little hanger on of the party, or pettifogging protector of the
firm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We speak of these things in the bitterness of scorn. It is
unnecessary to cite instances, where one is found in almost
every issue of a book. It is needless to call to mind the
desperate case of Fay—a case where the pertinacity of the
effort to gull—where the obviousness of the attempt at forestalling
a judgment—where the wofully over-done be-Mirrorment
of that man-of-straw, together with the pitiable
platitude of his production, proved a dose somewhat too
potent for even the well-prepared stomach of the mob. We
say it is supererogatory to dwell upon “Norman Leslie,”
or other by-gone follies, when we have, before our eyes,
hourly instances of the machinations in question. To so
great an extent of methodical assurance has the <span class='it'>system</span> of
puffery arrived, that publishers, of late, have made no scruple
of keeping on hand an assortment of commendatory notices,
prepared by their men of all work, and of sending
these notices around to the multitudinous papers within
their influence, done up within the fly-leaves of the book.
The grossness of these base attempts, however, has not
escaped indignant rebuke from the more honorable portion
of the press; and we hail these symptoms of restiveness
under the yoke of unprincipled ignorance and quackery
(strong only in combination) as the harbinger of a better era
for the interests of real merit, and of the national literature
as a whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has become, indeed the plain duty of each individual
connected with our periodicals, heartily to give whatever
influence he possesses, to the good cause of integrity and the
truth. The results thus attainable will be found worthy his
closest attention and best efforts. We shall thus frown
down all conspiracies to foist inanity upon the public consideration
at the obvious expense of every man of talent who
is not a member of a <span class='it'>clique</span> in power. We may even arrive,
in time, at that desirable point from which a distinct view of
our men of letters may be obtained, and their respective
pretensions adjusted, by the standard of a rigorous and self-sustaining
criticism alone. That their several positions are
as yet properly settled; that the posts which a vast number
of them now hold are maintained by any better tenure than
that of the chicanery upon which we have commented, will
be asserted by none but the ignorant, or the parties who have
best right to feel an interest in the “good old condition of
things.” No two matters can be more radically different
than the reputation of some of our prominent <span class='it'>litterateurs</span>,
as gathered from the mouths of the people, (who glean it
from the paragraphs of the papers,) and the same reputation
as deduced from the private estimate of intelligent and educated
men. We do not advance this fact as a new discovery.
Its truth, on the contrary, is the subject, and has long been
so, of every-day witticism and mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why not? Surely there can be few things more ridiculous
than the general character and assumptions of the ordinary
critical notices of new books! An editor, sometimes
without the shadow of the commonest attainment—often
without brains, always without time—does not scruple to
give the world to understand that he is in the <span class='it'>daily</span> habit of
critically reading and deciding upon a flood of publications
one tenth of whose title-pages he may possibly have
turned over, three fourths of whose contents would be Hebrew
to his most desperate efforts at comprehension, and
whose entire mass and amount, as might be mathematically
demonstrated, would be sufficient to occupy, in the most
cursory perusal, the attention of some ten or twenty readers
for a month! What he wants in plausibility, however, he
makes up in obsequiousness; what he lacks in time he supplies
in temper. He is the most easily pleased man in the
world. He admires everything, from the big Dictionary
of Noah Webster to the last diamond edition of Tom
Thumb. Indeed his sole difficulty is in finding tongue to express
his delight. Every pamphlet is a miracle—every
book in boards is an epoch in letters. His phrases, therefore,
get bigger and bigger every day, and, if it were not for
talking Cockney, we might call him a “regular swell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet in the attempt at getting definite information in regard
to any one portion of our literature, the merely general
reader, or the foreigner, will turn in vain from the lighter to
the heavier journals. But it is not our intention here to
dwell upon the radical, antique, and systematized rigmarole
of our Quarterlies. The articles here are anonymous.
Who writes?—who causes to be written? Who but an ass
will put faith in tirades which <span class='it'>may</span> be the result of personal
hostility, or in panegyrics which nine times out of ten may
be laid, directly or indirectly, to the charge of the author
himself? It is in the favor of these saturnine pamphlets
that they contain, now and then, a good essay <span class='it'>de omnibus
rebus et quibusdam aliis</span>, which may be looked into, without
decided somnolent consequences, at any period not immediately
subsequent to dinner. But it is useless to expect
criticism from periodicals called “Reviews” from never reviewing.
Besides, all men know, or should know, that these
books are sadly given to verbiage. It is a part of their nature,
a condition of their being, a point of their faith. A
veteran reviewer loves the safety of generalities, and is
therefore rarely particular. “Words, words, words” are
the secret of his strength. He has one or two ideas of his
own, and is both wary and fussy in giving them out. His
wit lies with his truth, in a well, and there is always a world
of trouble in getting it up. He is a sworn enemy to all
things simple and direct. He gives no ear to the advice of
the giant Moulineau—“<span class='it'>Belier, mon ami, commencez au
commencement.</span>” He either jumps at once into the middle
of his subject, or breaks in at a back door, or sidles up to it
with the gait of a crab. No other mode of approach has an
air of sufficient profundity. When fairly into it, however,
he becomes dazzled with the scintillations of his own wisdom,
and is seldom able to see his way out. Tired of laughing
at his antics, or frightened at seeing him flounder, the
reader at length shuts him up, with the book. “What song
the Syrens sang,” says Sir Thomas Browne, “or what name
Achilles assumed when he hid himself among women,
though puzzling questions, are not beyond <span class='it'>all</span> conjecture”—but
it would puzzle Sir Thomas, backed by Achilles and all
the Syrens in Heathendom, to say, in nine cases out of ten,
<span class='it'>what is the object</span> of a thorough-going Quarterly Reviewer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Should the opinions promulgated by our press at large be
taken, in their wonderful aggregate, as an evidence of what
American literature absolutely is, (and it may be said that,
in general, they are really so taken,) we shall find ourselves
the most enviable set of people upon the face of the earth.
Our fine writers are legion. Our very atmosphere is redolent
of genius; and we, the nation, are a huge, well-contented
chameleon, grown pursy by inhaling it. We are <span class='it'>teretes
et rotundi</span>—enwrapped in excellence. All our poets are
Miltons, neither mute nor inglorious; all our poetesses are
“American Hemanses;” nor will it do to deny that all our
novelists are great Knowns or great Unknowns, and that
every body who writes, in every possible and impossible department,
is the admirable Crichton, or at least the admirable
Crichton’s ghost. We are thus in a glorious condition,
and will remain so until forced to disgorge our ethereal
honors. In truth, there is some danger that the jealousy of
the Old World will interfere. It cannot long submit to that
outrageous monopoly of “all the decency and all the talent”
in which the gentlemen of the press give such undoubted
assurance of our being so busily engaged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we feel angry with ourselves for the jesting tone of
our observations upon this topic. The prevalence of the
spirit of puffery is a subject far less for merriment than for
disgust. Its truckling, yet dogmatical character—its bold,
unsustained, yet self-sufficient and wholesale laudation—is
becoming, more and more, an insult to the common sense of
the community. Trivial as it essentially is, it has yet been
made the instrument of the grossest abuse in the elevation
of imbecility, to the manifest injury, to the utter ruin, of true
merit. Is there any man of good feeling and of ordinary understanding—is
there one single individual among all our
readers—who does not feel a thrill of bitter indignation,
apart from any sentiment of mirth, as he calls to mind instance
after instance of the purest, of the most unadulterated
quackery in letters, which has risen to a high post in the apparent
popular estimation, and which still maintains it, by
the sole means of a blustering arrogance, or of a busy wriggling
conceit, or of the most barefaced plagiarism, or even
through the simple immensity of its assumptions—assumptions
not only unopposed by the press at large, but absolutely
supported in proportion to the vociferous clamor with
which they are made—in exact accordance with their utter
baselessness and untenability? We should have no trouble
in pointing out, to-day, some twenty or thirty so-called literary
personages, who, if not idiots, as we half think them,
or if not hardened to all sense of shame by a long course of
disingenuousness, will now blush, in the perusal of these
words, through consciousness of the shadowy nature of that
purchased pedestal upon which they stand—will now tremble
in thinking of the feebleness of the breath which will be
adequate to the blowing it from beneath their feet. With the
help of a hearty good will, even <span class='it'>we</span> may yet tumble them
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So firm, through a long endurance, has been the hold
taken upon the popular mind (at least so far as we may
consider the popular mind reflected in ephemeral letters)
by the laudatory system which we have deprecated, that
what is, in its own essence, a vice, has become endowed
with the appearance, and met with the reception of a
virtue. Antiquity, as usual, has lent a certain degree of
speciousness even to the absurd. So continuously have
we puffed, that we have at length come to think puffing the
duty, and plain speaking the dereliction. What we began
in gross error, we persist in through habit. Having adopted,
in the earlier days of our literature, the untenable idea
that this literature, as a whole, could be advanced by an indiscriminate
approbation bestowed on its every effort—having
adopted this idea, we say, without attention to the
obvious fact that praise of all was bitter although negative
censure to the few alone deserving, and that the only result
of the system, in the fostering way, would be the fostering
of folly—we now continue our vile practices through the
supineness of custom, even while, in our national self-conceit,
we repudiate that necessity for patronage and protection
in which originated our conduct. In a word, the press
throughout the country has not been ashamed to make head
against the very few bold attempts at independence which
have, from time to time, been made in the face of the reigning
order of things. And if, in one, or perhaps two, insulated
cases, the spirit of severe truth, sustained by an unconquerable
will, was not to be so put down, then, forthwith, were
private chicaneries set in motion; then was had resort, on
the part of those who considered themselves injured by the
severity of criticism, (and who were so, if the just contempt
of every ingenuous man is injury,) resort to arts of the most
virulent indignity, to untraceable slanders, to ruthless assassination
in the dark. We say these things were done, while
the press in general looked on, and, with a full understanding
of the wrong perpetrated, spoke not against the wrong.
The idea had absolutely gone abroad—had grown up little
by little into toleration—that attacks however just, upon a
literary reputation however obtained, however untenable,
were well retaliated by the basest and most unfounded traduction
of personal fame. But is this an age—is this a
day—in which it can be necessary even to advert to such
considerations as that the book of the author is the property
of the public, and that the issue of the book is the throwing
down of the gauntlet to the reviewer—to the reviewer
whose duty is the plainest; the duty not even of approbation,
or of censure, or of silence, at his own will, but at the
sway of those sentiments and of those opinions which are
derived from the author himself, through the medium of his
written and published words? True criticism is the reflection
of the thing criticised upon the spirit of the critic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But <span class='it'>à nos moutons</span>—to the “Quacks of Helicon.” This
satire has many faults besides those upon which we have
commented. The tide, for example, is not sufficiently distinctive,
although otherwise good. It does not confine the
subject to <span class='it'>American</span> quacks, while the work does. The two
concluding lines enfeeble instead of strengthening the <span class='it'>finale</span>,
which would have been exceedingly pungent without them.
The individual portions of the thesis are strung together too
much at random—a natural sequence is not always preserved—so
that although the lights of the picture are often
forcible, the whole has what, in artistical parlance, is termed
an accidental and spotty appearance. In truth, the parts of
the poem have evidently been composed each by each, as
separate themes, and afterwards fitted into the general satire,
in the best manner possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a more reprehensible sin than any or than all of these
is yet to be mentioned—the sin of indiscriminate censure.
Even here Mr. Wilmer has erred through imitation. He
has held in view the sweeping denunciations of the Dunciad,
and of the later (abortive) satire of Byron. No one in his
senses can deny the justice of the general charges of corruption
in regard to which we have just spoken from the
text of our author. But are there <span class='it'>no</span> exceptions? We
should indeed blush if there were not. And is there <span class='it'>no</span>
hope? Time will show. We cannot do everything in a
day—<span class='it'>Non se gano Zamora en un ora</span>. Again, it cannot
be gainsaid that the greater number of those who hold high
places in our poetical literature are absolute nincompoops—fellows
alike innocent of reason and of rhyme. But neither
are we <span class='it'>all</span> brainless, nor is the devil himself so black as he
is painted. Mr. Wilmer must read the chapter in Rabelais’
<span class='it'>Gargantua</span>, “<span class='it'>de ce qu’ est signifié par les couleurs blanc
et bleu</span>”—for there is <span class='it'>some</span> difference after all. It will not
do in a civilized land to run a-muck like a Malay. Mr.
Morris <span class='it'>has</span> written good songs. Mr. Bryant is not <span class='it'>all</span> a fool.
Mr. Willis is not <span class='it'>quite</span> an ass. Mr. Longfellow <span class='it'>will</span> steal,
but perhaps he cannot help it, (for we have heard of such
things,) and then it must not be denied that <span class='it'>nil tetigit quod
non ornavit</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact is that our author, in the rank exuberance of his
zeal, seems to think as little of discrimination as the Bishop
of Autun<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> did of the Bible. Poetical “things in general” are
the windmills at which he spurs his rozinante. He as often
tilts at what is true as at what is false; and thus his lines
are like the mirrors of the temples of Smirna, which represent
the fairest images as deformed. But the talent, the
fearlessness, and especially the <span class='it'>design</span> of this book, will suffice
to save it even from that dreadful damnation of “silent
contempt” to which editors throughout the country, if we
are not very much mistaken, will endeavor, one and all, to
consign it.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Biography and Poetical Remains of the late Margaret
Miller Davidson. By</span> <span class='sc'>Washington Irving</span>. <span class='it'>Philadelphia:
Lea and Blanchard.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The name of Lucretia Davidson is familiar to all readers
of Poetry. Dying at the early age of seventeen, she has been
rendered famous not less, and certainly not more, by her
own precocious genius than by three memorable biographies—one
by President Morse, of the American Society of
Arts, another by Miss Sedgwick, and a third by Robert
Southey. Mr. Irving had formed an acquaintance with some
of her relatives, and thus, while, in Europe, took great interest
in all that was said or written of his young countrywoman.
Upon his return to America, he called upon Mrs.
Davidson, and then, in 1833, first saw the subject of the
memoir now before us—a fairy-like child of eleven. Three
years afterwards he met with her again, and then found her
in delicate health. Three years having again elapsed, the
MSS. which form the basis of the present volume, were
placed in his hands by Mrs. Davidson, as all that remained
of her daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few books have interested us more profoundly. Yet the
interest does not appertain solely to Margaret. “In fact the
narrative,” says Mr. Irving, “will be found almost as illustrative
of the character of the mother as of the child; they
were singularly identified in taste, feeling, and pursuits;
tenderly entwined together by maternal and filial affection,
they reflected an inexpressibly touching grace and interest
upon each other by this holy relationship, and, to my mind
it would be marring one of the most beautiful and affecting
groups in modern literature, to sunder them.” In these
words the biographer conveys no more than a just idea of
the exquisite loveliness of the picture here presented to
view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The MSS. handed Mr. Irving, have been suffered, in great
measure, to tell their own thrilling tale. There has been no
injudicious attempt at mere authorship. The compiler has
confined himself to chronological arrangement of his memoranda,
and to such simple and natural comments as serve to
bind rather than to illustrate where no illustration was
needed. These memoranda consist of relations by Mrs. Davidson
of the infantine peculiarities of her daughter, and of
her habits and general thoughts in more matured life, intermingled
with letters from the young poetess to intimate
friends. There is also a letter from the bereaved mother to
Miss Sedgwick, detailing the last moments of the child—a
letter so full of all potent nature, so full of minute beauty
and truth and pathos, that to read it without tears would be to
prove one’s self less than human.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “Poetical Remains” of this young creature, who
perished (of consumption) in her sixteenth year, occupy
about two hundred pages of a somewhat closely printed
octavo. The longest poem is called “Lenore,” and consists
of some two thousand lines, varying in metre from the ordinary
octo-syllabic, to the four-footed, or twelve-syllabled
iambic. The story, which is a romantic love-tale, not ill-conceived
in its incidents, is told with a skill which might
put more practised bards to the blush, and with occasional
bursts of the truest poetic fire. But although as indicative
of her future power, it is the most important, as it is the
longest of her productions, yet as a whole it is not equal to
some of her shorter compositions. It was written not long
before her death, at the age of fifteen, and (as we glean from
the biography) after patient reflection, with much care, and
with a high resolve to do something for fame. As the work
of so mere a child, it is unquestionably wonderful. Its
<span class='it'>length</span>, viewed in connection with its keeping, its unity, its
adaptation, and completeness, will impress the metaphysician
most forcibly, when surveying the capacities of its
author. Powers are here brought into play which are the
last to be matured. For fancy we might have looked, and
for the lower evidences of skill in a perfect versification and
the like, but hardly for what we see in Lenore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet remarkable as this production is, from the pen of a
girl of fifteen, it is by no means so incomprehensible as are
some of the shorter pieces. We have known instances—rarely,
to be sure—but still we have known instances when
finer poems in every respect than Lenore have been written
by children of as immature age—but we look around us in
vain for anything composed at eight years, which can bear
comparison with the lines subjoined—</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the way of criticism upon these extraordinary compositions,
Mr. Irving has attempted little, and, in general, he
seems more affected by the loveliness and the purity of the
child than even by the genius she has evinced—however
highly he may have estimated this latter. In respect, however,
to a poem entitled “My Sister Lucretia,”—he thus
speaks—“We have said that the example of her sister Lucretia
was incessantly before her, and no better proof can
be given of it than in the following lines, which breathe the
heavenly aspirations of her pure young spirit, <span class='it'>in strains to
us quite unearthly. We may have read poetry more</span>
<span class='it'>artificially perfect in its structure, but never any more
truly divine in its inspiration.</span>” The nature of inspiration
is disputable—and we will not pretend to assert that Mr.
Irving is in the wrong. His words, however, in their hyperbole,
do wrong to his subject, and would be hyperbole still,
if applied to the most exalted poets of all time.</p>

Arabia Petrea, and Palestine,” was everywhere well received,
and gained him high reputation—reputation not
altogether well deserved. No one can deny his personal
merits as a traveller, his enthusiasm, boldness, acuteness,
courage in danger, and perseverance under difficulty. His
manner of narration is also exceedingly pleasing; frank,
unembarrassed and direct, without pretension or attempt at
effect. But neither were his reflections characterised by
profundity, nor had he that degree of education which
would have enabled him to travel, with benefit to himself or
to others, through regions involving so much of historical
importance as Egypt, and especially as Arabia Petrea.
Through a deficiency of previous information in regard to
the moot points of this classical ground, he suffered many
things to pass unexamined, whose examination would have
thrown light upon history, and lustre upon his own name.
Our remarks here apply more particularly to the southern
regions of Arabia. In regard to Arabia Petrea, he committed
some errors of magnitude. Before entering upon his
travels, he had been much interested in Keith’s book upon
the literal fulfilment of the Biblical Prophecies. In this
work the predictions of Isaiah, respecting the ancient Idumea,
are especially insisted upon, and the sentence, “<span class='it'>None
shall pass through thee forever and ever</span>,” quoted as a
remarkable instance of literal fulfilment. Dr. Keith states
roundly that all attempts at passing through Idumea have actually
failed, and expresses his belief that such will always
be the case. Mr. Stephens resolved to test this point, and
congratulates himself and his readers upon the success of
his attempt at traversing the disputed region from one end
to the other. The truth is, however, that Arabia Petrea,
through which he unquestionably did pass, <span class='it'>is not at all the
Idumea alluded to in the prophecies</span>, this latter lying much
farther to the eastward. The traveller had contented himself
with the usual understanding upon this subject. In the
matter of the prophecy, both he and Dr. Keith might have
spared themselves much trouble by an examination of the
Biblical text in the original, before founding a question upon
it. In an article on this head, which appeared in the New
York Review, we pointed out an obvious mistranslation in
the Hebrew words of the prediction—a mistranslation
which proves Mr. Stephens to have thrown away his courage
and labor. The passage in Isaiah 34, 10, which is rendered
in our bibles by the sentence, “And none shall pass
through thee forever and ever,” runs in the original Hebrew
thus—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Lenetsach metsachim ein over bah.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Literally—<span class='it'>Lenetsach</span>, for an eternity; <span class='it'>metsachim</span>, of eternities;
<span class='it'>ein</span>, not; <span class='it'>over</span>, moving about; <span class='it'>bah</span>, in it. For an
eternity of eternities (there shall) not (be any one) moving
about in it. The literal meaning of <span class='it'>bah</span> is “in it,” and not
“through it.” The participle <span class='it'>over</span>, refers to one moving to
and fro, or up and down, and is the same phrase which is
rendered “current,” as an epithet applied to money, in Genesis,
23, 16. The prophet only intends to say that there
shall be no marks of life in the land, no living being there,
no one moving up and down in it. A similar mistranslation
exists in regard to the prophecy in Ezekiel, 35, 7, where
death is threatened (according to the usual construction) to
any traveller who shall <span class='it'>pass through</span>. The words are</p>

<p class='noindent'>Literally, “And I will give the mountain Seir for a desolation
and a desolation, and I will cut off from it him that
goeth and him that returneth.” By “him that goeth and him
that returneth,” reference is had to the passers to and fro,
to the inhabitants. The prophet speaks only of the general
abandonment and desolation of the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are not prepared to say that misunderstandings of this
character will be found in the present “Incidents of Travel.”
Of Central America, and her antiquities, Mr. Stephens may
know, and no doubt does know, as much as the most learned
antiquarian. Here all is darkness. We have not yet received
from the Messieurs Harper a copy of the book, and
can only speak of its merits from general report, and from
the cursory perusal which has been afforded us by the politeness
of a friend. The work is certainly a magnificent
one—perhaps the most interesting book of travel ever published.
An idea has gone abroad that the narrative is confined
to descriptions and drawings of Palenque; but this is
very far from the case. Mr. S. explored no less than six
ruined cities. The “incidents,” moreover, are numerous,
and highly amusing. The traveller visited these regions at
a momentous time; during the civil war, in which Carrera
and Morazan were participants. He encountered many
dangers, and his hair-breadth escapes are particularly exciting.</p>

some respects, merit of a high order. His themes are
often well selected, lofty, and giving evidence of the true

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Will <span class='it'>any</span> one be kind enough to tell us who is Mr. Clinton
Roosevelt? We wish to know, of course. Mr. Roosevelt
has published a little book. It consists of a hundred little
pages. Ten of these pages would make one of our own.
But a clever man may do a great thing in a small way, and
Mr. Roosevelt is unquestionably a clever man. For this we
have his own word, and who should know all about it better
than he? Hear him!—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Learned men have long contended that it was impossible
for any human intellect to grasp what has been here attempted;—that
a Cyclopædia only could embrace in one
view all the arts and sciences which minister to man’s necessity
and happiness—and <span class='it'>that</span> they give but little credit
for, as a Cyclopædia is a mere arbitary [we follow Mr. R.’s
spelling as in duty bound] alphabetical arrangement. <span class='it'>We</span>
[Mr. Roosevelt is a <span class='it'>we</span>] would not say we have done even
what we have without much toil and sacrifice. It has cost
the best ten years of the writer’s life to settle its great principles,
and give it form and substance. The great interests
of man were in a state of chaos, and this science [Mr. Roosevelt’s]
is to harmonise them, and run side by side with true
religion so far as that is meant ‘to feed the hungry, clothe
the naked, and make on earth peace and good will to
man.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah!—we begin to breathe freely once more. We <span class='it'>had</span>
thought that the world and all in it (this hot weather) were
going to the dogs,—“proceeding to the canines,” as Bilberry
has it—but here is Mr. Roosevelt, and we feel more assured.
We entrench ourselves in security behind his little book.
“A larger work,” says he, “would have been more imposing
in appearance, but the truth is, large works and long
speeches are rarely made by men of powerful thought.”
Never was anything more true. “As to boasting,” he continues,
very continuously, “the writer is well aware that it
is the worst policy imaginable.” In this opinion we do not
so entirely acquiesce. “The little man”—says he—the
reader will perceive that we are so rapt in admiration of Mr.
Roosevelt that we quote him at random—“The little man
may say this book was not done <span class='it'>secundum artem</span>—not
nicely or critically.” He must be a <span class='it'>very</span> little man indeed,
who would say so. <span class='it'>We</span> think he has done it <span class='it'>quite</span> nicely.
“My tone”—we here go on with Mr. Roosevelt—“may
seem not strictly according to <span class='it'>bien science</span>.” Oh, yes is it,
Mr. Roosevelt; don’t distress yourself now—it is, we assure
you, very strictly according to <span class='it'>bien science</span>, (good heavens!)
and to every thing else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These remarks,” he observes, “are made that none may
lightly damn the work.” Of course; any one who should
damn it lightly should be damned himself. “But liberal
criticism [ah! that is the thing,] will be accepted as a
favor, [the smallest favors thankfully accepted] and
writers who may undertake the task will confer an obligation
by directing a copy of their articles to the author, at
New York, from England, France or Germany, or any part
of our own country where this work may reach.” Certainly;
no critic could do less—no liberal critic. We shall
send Mr. Roosevelt a copy of our criticism from Philadelphia,
and we would do the same thing if we were living at
Timbuctoo.</p>

Blanchard.</span> <span class='it'>2 vols. Lea and Blanchard.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This work contains the most authentic biography of the
lamented L. E. L. yet issued from the press, together with a
collection of her posthumous pieces, and several lighter effusions
already published. The volumes possess uncommon
interest. The detail of her every-day life, the picture of
her gaiety and sweetness, and the criticisms on her genius,
will commend it to all who have loved, in other days, the
poetry of this sweet writer. Nor will the details of her
melancholy death prove of less interest. After fully examining
all the evidence relating to this tragedy, the author
arrives at the conclusion that her death was natural, and instigated
neither by her own sorrows nor by the jealousy of
others. The conduct of her husband seems, in every respect,
to have been without censure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the genius of Miss Landon it is almost unnecessary to
speak. Without the elegance of Mrs. Hemans, she had considerable
grace; with a fine ear, she was often careless in
her rhythm; possessing a fancy exuberant and glowing, she
showered her metaphors too indiscriminately around her.
But few equalled her—if we may so speak—in the <span class='it'>passionate
purity</span> of her verse. Affection breathed through
every line she wrote. Perhaps there was a mannerism, certainly
an affectation, in her constant reference to love, and
blighted love especially; but even this error was made seductive
by the never-ceasing variety which she contrived to
throw around her theme, and the sweetness, richness, and enthusiasm
of her song. Her great faults were a want of
method, and a careless, rapid habit of composition. From
first to last, she was emphatically an “<span class='it'>improvisatrice</span>.”
She wrote from whim rather than from plan, and consequently
was often trite, and always careless. These observations
will apply, we think, equally to her prose. Her
“Ethell Churchill” may be taken as a specimen, and the
best specimen, of her style in romance writing. It would
be almost invidious to name any one of her long poems as
the finest. In her shorter pieces she is often more successful
than in more extended flights; and some of her most
carelessly written stanzas glitter most with the dew of Castaly.
Without fear of contradiction, we may say that she
has left no living female poet to compete with her in fame,
unless Mrs. Norton may be said to be her rival; and even
with Mrs. Norton, so different are the two writers, no parallel
can be drawn. Let us be contented with placing Hemans,
Landon and Norton together in one glorious trio—the sweetest,
brightest, loftiest of the female poets of the present generation.</p>

Other Subjects. By</span> <span class='sc'>George W. Burnap</span>, <span class='it'>Pastor of the
First Independent Church of Baltimore. Philadelphia:
Kay and Co.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These lectures are designed as a <span class='it'>pendant</span> to a course delivered
to the Young Men of Baltimore, last winter, by Mr.
Burnap. From the “Sphere and Duties” of Woman the author
has excluded all allusion to her physical education and
her political rights—regarding the first as a topic for the
physician, the last for the jurist. Perhaps this subdivision
is injudicious. At all events, from what we here know of
Mr. Burnap, we should have been pleased to have his subject
extended to Woman in all her relations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The volume appears to us not only well written, but forcibly
original in many of its views and illustrations. A passage,
at page 50, in which the lecturer suggests the idea of
an instinctive reverence in which each sex holds the other,
is not only new, but embodies a truth of important result.
Mr. B. justly styles the feeling a human religion. Its moral
effects are unquestionably great. The deterioration of every
community which isolates the sexes, or prevents their free
intercommunication, is here traced to a distinct and sufficient
cause.</p>

would form an appropriate present to any lady.</p>

<div><h1><a id='sec'></a>SECRET WRITING.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Our remarks on this head, in the July number, have excited
much interest. The subject is unquestionably one of
importance, when we regard cryptography as an exercise for
the analytical faculties. In this view, men of the finest abilities
have given it much of their attention; and the invention
of a perfect cipher was a point to which Lord Chancellor
Bacon devoted many months;—devoted them in vain,
for the cryptograph which he has thought worthy a place
in his <span class='it'>De Augmentis</span>, is one which can be solved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as we were going to press with the last sheet of this
number, we received the following letter from F. W. Thomas,
Esq., (of Washington,) the well-known author of “Clinton
Bradshawe,” “Howard Pinckney,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>My Dear Sir</span>:—The enclosed cryptograph is from a
friend of mine (Dr. Frailey,) who thinks he can puzzle you.
If you decipher it, then are you a magician, for he has used,
as I think, the greatest art in making it.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;'>Your friend,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>F. W. Thomas</span>.</p>

</div>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/crypto.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0005' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>This cipher is printed precisely as we received it, with
the exception that we have substituted, for convenience sake,
in some instances, characters that we have in the office, for
others that we have not. Of course, as these characters are
substituted <span class='it'>throughout</span>, the cryptograph is not affected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By return of mail we sent the solution to Mr. Thomas; but
as the cipher is an exceedingly ingenious one, we forbear
publishing its translation here, and prefer testing the ability
of our readers to solve it. <span class='it'>We will give a year’s subscription
to the Magazine, and also a year’s subscription to
the Saturday Evening Post, to any person, or rather to
the first person who shall read us this riddle.</span> We have
no expectation that it will be read; and, therefore, should
the month pass without an answer forthcoming, we will
furnish the key to the cipher, and again offer a year’s subscription
to the Magazine, to any person who shall solve it
<span class='it'>with the key</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lest the tenor of our observations on Cryptography should
be misunderstood, and especially lest the nature of our challenge
should be misconceived, we take occasion to refer to
our Review of Mr. Walsh’s “Sketches of Conspicuous
Living Characters of France,” published in the April number
of the Magazine. M. Berryer, the French Minister, is
there said to have displayed the highest ingenuity in the solution
of a cipher addressed by the Duchess of Berri to the
legitimists of Paris, but of which she had neglected to furnish
the key. Berryer discovered this to be the phrase “Le
gouvernement provisoire.” Beneath this sentence the alphabet
had been placed, letter for letter; and thus when <span class='it'>a</span>
was intended <span class='it'>l</span> was written, when <span class='it'>b</span> was meant <span class='it'>e</span> was substituted,
and so on throughout. This species of cryptograph
is justly considered very difficult. We remarked, however,
that we would engage to read any one <span class='it'>of the kind</span>; and to
this limit our correspondents must confine themselves. To
be sure, we said, in our last number, that “human ingenuity
could not construct a cipher which human ingenuity could
not resolve”—but then we do not propose, just now, to
make ourselves individually the test of “human ingenuity”
in general. We do not propose to solve <span class='it'>all</span> ciphers.
Whether we can or cannot do this is a question for another
day—a day when we have more leisure than at present we
have any hope of enjoying. The most simple cryptograph
requires, in its solution, labor, patience, and much time.
We therefore abide by the limits of our cartel. It is true
that in attempting the perusal of Dr. Frailey’s we have exceeded
these limits by very much; but we were seduced
into the endeavor to read it by the decided manner in which
an opinion was expressed that we could not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>E. St. J. will observe that his cipher includes <span class='it'>every</span> letter
of the natural alphabet. Then (admitting it to be a cipher
of the kind proposed) his key-phrase must contain every
letter of the natural alphabet. In such case no letter of the
phrase can stand <span class='it'>for more than one</span> of the alphabet, and the
whole would be nothing more than a simple cipher, where
the natural characters are represented, invariably and respectively,
by arbitrary ones. But in this supposition there
could be no such words as <span class='it'>ll</span>, &amp;c.—words seen in the cryptograph.
<span class='it'>Therefore</span>, his cipher is <span class='it'>not</span> within the limits
prescribed—Q. E. D. We do not say that we <span class='it'>cannot</span> solve
it, but that we will not make the attempt. This for the obvious
reasons above assigned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>P. S. We have just received the annexed letter from Mr.
Thomas, enclosing one from Dr. Frailey:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Washington</span>, July 6th, 1841.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>My Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>This morning I received yours of yesterday, deciphering
the “cryptograph” which I sent you last week, from my
friend, Doctor Frailey. You request that I would obtain the
Doctor’s acknowledgment of your solution. I have just received
the enclosed from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doctor Frailey had heard me speak of your having deciphered
a letter which our mutual friend, Dow, wrote upon
a challenge from you last year, at my lodgings in your city,
when Aaron Burr’s correspondence in cipher was the subject
of our conversation. You laughed at what you termed
Burr’s shallow artifice, and said you could decipher any
such cryptography easily. To test you on the spot, Dow
withdrew to the corner of the room, and wrote a letter in
cipher, which you solved in a much shorter time than it
took him to indite it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Doctor Frailey seemed to doubt your skill to the extent
of my belief in it, when your article on “Secret Writing”
appeared in the last number of your Magazine, I showed it
to him. After reading it, he remarked that he thought he
could puzzle you, and the next day he handed me the cryptograph
which I transmitted to you. He did not tell me the
key. The uncommon nature of his article, of which I gave
you not the slightest hint, made me express to you my strong
doubts of your ability to make the solution. I confess that
your solution, so speedily and correctly made, surprised me.
I congratulate myself that I do not live in an age when the
black art is believed in, for, innocent as I am of all knowledge
of cryptography, I should be arrested as an accessory
before the fact, and, though I escaped, it is certain that you
would have to die the death, and, alas! I fear upon my testimony.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
